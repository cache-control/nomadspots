    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>South Temple Wash is a fee campground in the San Rafael Swell Recreation Area.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>South Temple Wash campground is located along the Temple Mountain Road on the east side of the Reef. A short distance back to the east of the campground is the turn to go to Goblin Valley State Park. Turning west before the entrance of the state park will lead to Little Wild Horse Canyon, a popular hike for many in a slot canyon. From the campground and driving west on the Temple Mountain Road will lead to the Temple Mountain Pictograph Panel, a short drive further is Temple Mountain Townsite. Here visitors can hike to reclaimed uranium mines. Opposite Temple Mountain Townsite is The Behind-the-Reef Road and it is accessible to most vehicles for six miles, accessing several trailheads for hikes into the San Rafael Reef Wilderness. Two of these (Chute Canyon and Wild Horse Canyon) are accessible for horseback riders. The road continues for another 14 miles requiring high clearance and four-wheel-drive as it follows the rugged base of the reef against a backdrop of 500-foot cliffs and jagged canyons. After about seven miles, the road narrows to a maximum vehicle width of 50 feet. More wilderness slot canyons hikes can be accessed from this road. Motorized vehicle use is not permitted in wilderness. </p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>South Temple Wash has two vault toilets and an information kiosk. All campsites have fire rings, flat gravel surfaces, and picnic tables.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>The campground is at the Eastern mouth of a short, steep canyon (Temple Wash) which cuts through the San Rafael Reef. One of the most distinctive geologic features of central Utah, the Reef is a 75-mile-long rocky spine that reaches up to 1,000 feet high and forms the eastern edge of the San Rafael Swell. The Temple Mountain area provides acces to many scenic slot canyons, hills, and spires cut from red and white rock.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Goblin Valley State Park (fee area), 2 miles east: The state park entrance is two miles up the Temple Wash Road going back towards Highway 24. The state park is famous for its unique landscape of sandstone hoodoos (goblins) and buttes. The park has hiking and mountain biking trails as well as a fee campground and yurt rentals.</p>\n<p>Little Wild Horse Canyon: The Little Wild Horse slot canyon is the most popular hike in the San Rafael Reef. Visitors can appreciate sculpted sandstone walls and narrows through the three-mile canyon. Paired with Bell Canyon via the Behind-the-Reef Road, this makes for an eight-mile moderate day hike with varied scenery. The canyon bottoms are gravel and there are some obstacles requiring straightforward scrambling.</p>\n<p>Temple Mountain Mining District: The townsite is in the heart of the historic Temple Mountain Mining District. Visitors can visit sites and learn about the history of Cold War-era uranium mining by foot or vehicle.</p>\n\n<h2>Contact Info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (435) 636-3600.",

Trails are marked with flexible fiberglass markers with the trail name or an arrow attached to the marker. Cross-country horse and foot travel is allowed. Mountain bikes are strongly encouraged to stay on established trails to protect the rider as well as the landscape. The trails offer great views of the surrounding Sacramento and Capitan Mountains. The majority of the trails start at the Rob Jaggers Camping Area on NM 220 where you will find hitching rails, water for your animals, and a vault toilet. </p>\n<p>Rio Bonito Petroglyph National Recreation Trail</p>\n<p>Hike the Petroglyph Trail along the Rio Bonito and glimpse into the past. At the midpoint of the Trail, in the river bed, is Petroglyph Rock. Etched on this rock are depictions of an ancient people known as the Jornada Mogollon who have long since left the area. Very little evidence has stood the test of time, but here on the Petroglyph Trail remains a link to the culture and lifestyle of these ancient people. </p>\n<p>The Trail can be reached from NM 220, west of the Sierra Blanca Regional Airport. Follow the highway signs stating “Upper Rio Bonito” to the bottom of the hill and turn right for approximately 250 ft then take the next left until you reach the trailhead (high-clearance vehicles are recommended). Petroglyph Rock is a short 450 ft walk from the parking area. The loop trail is approximately 2.1 miles in total length and is easy-to-moderate hiking with a few hills and areas with loose footing. Plan to spend approximately one hour on the Trail. </p>\n<p>Historical Sites </p>\n<p>Historic Fort Stanton is one of very few intact frontier forts in the West. Many of the original Fort buildings still stand. From 1855 to 1896, the Fort played host to some of the most colorful units and personalities of the West, including the 9th Cavalry, and the 24th, 57th, and 125th Infantry Buffalo Soldiers, Billy the Kid, Lew Wallace, Colonel Kit Carson, and General “Black Jack” Pershing. The post was also a Merchant Marine hospital & tuberculosis sanatorium, and World War II prisoner of war camp. In 1953, the Fort and 1,320 surrounding acres were transferred from Federal to State ownership, becoming a state hospital and training school until 1955. Today, the Fort area is active with other State activities and the Fort Stanton Museum is open on a daily basis (http://fortstanton.org/). </p>\n<p>Caving </p>\n<p>Fort Stanton Cave </p>\n<p>With over 40 miles of mapped passages, the Cave is normally open for recreational caving under permit from April 15 to November 1.

Plan to spend approximately one hour on the Trail. </p>\n<p>Historical Sites </p>\n<p>Historic Fort Stanton is one of very few intact frontier forts in the West. Many of the original Fort buildings still stand. From 1855 to 1896, the Fort played host to some of the most colorful units and personalities of the West, including the 9th Cavalry, and the 24th, 57th, and 125th Infantry Buffalo Soldiers, Billy the Kid, Lew Wallace, Colonel Kit Carson, and General “Black Jack” Pershing. The post was also a Merchant Marine hospital & tuberculosis sanatorium, and World War II prisoner of war camp. In 1953, the Fort and 1,320 surrounding acres were transferred from Federal to State ownership, becoming a state hospital and training school until 1955. Today, the Fort area is active with other State activities and the Fort Stanton Museum is open on a daily basis (http://fortstanton.org/). </p>\n<p>Caving </p>\n<p>Fort Stanton Cave </p>\n<p>With over 40 miles of mapped passages, the Cave is normally open for recreational caving under permit from April 15 to November 1.

This campground gives visitors a remote and backcountry feel while only being a few minutes drive from I-15 and the amenities of town. The campground also serves as one of the trailheads to the Iron Hills Trail System.</p>\n\n<p>The site is located 3.4 miles outside of the south end of town. Temperatures typically remain cool in the spring and late fall with low's during these times approaching or below freezing. Summer temperatures can often bring the high's into the range of 90-95 degrees Fahrnheit.</p>\n\n<p>The Iron Hills Trail System began as just a 5 mile loop and has since emerged into almost 30 miles of high quality mountain bike trails. While riders from all over the country have begun to travel to Cedar City to ride these trails, hikers, dog walkers, and nature lovers of all sorts will enjoy them as well. No matter which one of the 14 sites you chose from, you can access the Turnpike Trail from your campsite.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>The Turnpike trail leads straight out of the campground and provides bikers, hikers, trail runners, and more with access to almost 30 miles of singletrack. Almost all of the trails in this Iron Hills Trail System have been professionally constructed, and they have played a big role in Cedar City emerging as a premier mountain biking destination.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Each campsite at Pyramid Ridge Campground has in-site parking, a large picnic table, fire ring with optional grate for grilling, and at least one tent pad. Select sites contain parking spots to hold a large RV/camper or multiple vehicles and have multiple tent pads. While there is no water available at the campground, visitors can access water and other amenities in town just a few minutes away. The campground also serves as a trailhead which gives campers the opportunity to access almost 30 miles of trail from their campsite. The trailhead contains a bicycle repair station as well as the campground's restroom.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>Nestled into the base of the mountain, the Pyramid Ridge Campground gets its name from the geologic features that tower above it. Campers will get to experience sunrise and sunset in one of the most beautiful locations that Cedar City, UT has to offer. Large sandstone monoliths emerge out of the mountain in multiple locations, adding beautiful red, orange and yellow contrast to the green pinyon-juniper forest that blankets the mountain side.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Well known as  \"Festival Town USA,\" Cedar City, UT almost always has something going on. Visitors that are looking to stay close to camp can check out attractions like the Southern Utah Museum of Art, Frontier Homestead State Park, or certain times of year even enjoy  a day at the world famous Shakespeare Festival. Pyramid Ridge  Campground is only one hour from Zion National Park and just over a 1.5 hour drive to Bryce Canyon National Park. </p>\n",

Payments can be made by cash, check, or scan and pay through the Recreation.gov mobile app. </p>\n<p>Please contact the BLM Moab Field Office with questions by email: blm_ut_mb_mail@blm.gov or phone: 435-259-2100.</p>\n<p>Ken's Lake Campground is a part of the Ken's Lake Recreation Area. The area includes Ken's Lake, a man made reservoir (electric motors only - gas powered engines are prohibited), day use area with a gravel boat ramp, campground, and hiking/equestrian trails. Construction of the reservoir was part of the Mill Creek Project, completed in 1981, which also included a pressurized irrigation water delivery system. In 2000, the site was constructed into a campground and day use area for visitors to enjoy the surrounding recreational activities and scenic vistas. </p>\n<p>Located 10 miles south of Moab, Ken's Lake is surrounded by red rock fins to the east, sage brush flats to the south and west, and a reservoir to the north. Distant views from the campground also include the La Sal Mountains and red rock Moab Rim. This site is located at 5,085 feet elevation, similar to Moab. Be prepared October to March for lows below freezing and from June to August highs from 95 to above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  </p>\n<p>This campground is comprised of loops A and B. Loop A has no vegetation providing shade and is closed during low use season (summer and winter; exact dates vary each year). Loop B stays open year round and has a variety of sites with juniper and cottonwood trees providing shade and privacy. </p>\n<p>Loop A is popular with visitors that have large motorhomes and trailers. Loop B has smaller sites and it is difficult for large motorhomes and trailers to turn-around. </p>\n<p>The south end of the Steel Bender Jeep Safari Route runs next to the campground, so Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) users are also drawn to this area. Other popular activities originating from the campground or day use area include: hiking, horseback riding, fishing, and non-motorized boating. There are over 3 miles of trails in the lake vicinity with views of the Moab Valley, Faux Falls, La Sal Mountains, and Ken's Lake.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>The town of Moab is a hub for recreation. Tour operators offer guided hikes, rentals and evening entertainment.

Campground hosts assist visitors with acquiring a campsite, trip planning, and campground etiquette education.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>A few miles east of the campground, Mill Creek flows out of the La Sal Mountains. Water from this creek has been diverted to flow along a creek on the north side of the campground and is captured at Ken's Lake Reservoir. Along the diverted creek's path is Faux Falls. From the campground, visitors can hike or ride horseback on a trail to the falls or directly to the lake.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Arches and Canyonlands National Parks and Hovenweep and Natural Bridges National Monuments are nearby.

It offers vistas of the Brooks Range and has access to the nearby undeveloped trail up to Marion Creek falls. The campground is a perfect basecamp for exploring Alaska’s Brooks Range. There are 27 sites, three of which are accessible. The site is located five miles north of Coldfoot.</p>\n<p>This location is available on a first-come, first-serve basis only. Visitors are required to physically arrive at the campground to claim and purchase a site. Once on-site, you can pay for your campsites(s) by scanning a QR code using the Recreation.gov mobile app. Download the free Recreation.gov mobile app on Android or iOS prior to your arrival as this is a remote area that has limited or no cellular service. More reliable cellular service can be found 5 miles south in Coldfoot.</p>\n\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>The Brooks Range offers excellent recreation opportunities. Explore undesignated routes from the Dalton Highway. Hiking is plentiful up and into the mountains where ridges and drainages provide firm footing, and the forest thins to low-growing tundra. Hiking east from the highway will lead you to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while hiking west of the highway will take you towards Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Choose your route with care, let someone know where you plan on going, carry bear deterrent, and bring topographic maps, a GPS, and a compass with you.</p>\n<p>Panning for gold is allowed on a few federal stream segments along the Dalton Highway south of Atigun Pass (Milepost 244). No panning is permitted in the pipeline right-of-way (27 feet/8.2 m on either side of the pipeline) and no panning on federal mining claims without permission. Suction dredging is prohibited in the Utility Corridor. Visit the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center in Coldfoot to get more information on where you may legally pan for gold. </p>\n<p>There are several excellent river trips along the Dalton:</p>\n<p>•\tThe Jim River and Middle Fork of the Koyukuk River: Class I-II, several access points along the highway.</p>\n<p>•\tAtigun and Sagavanirktok (the Sag) Rivers: Class III-IV+ whitewater, access Atigun at Milepost 271; Sag at MP 306. For expert boaters only.</p>\n<p>•\tIvishak Wild and Scenic River: Class II, access by chartered air service from Deadhorse or Coldfoot.</p>\n<p>Other recreational activities include, bird watching, wildflower spotting/identifying, fishing, bicycling and hunting. </p>\n<p>More detailed information  on all these activities is available at the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center.</p>\n<p>State statute prohibits off-road vehicle use within 5 miles either side of from the highway from the Yukon River to the Arctic Ocean.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The roads, tenting areas, and parking aprons have a gravel surface. There are 27 sites, one of which is designated accessible. Fourteen sites are pull-through, allowing easy access for RVs. The campground has potable water, vault toilets, and trash receptacles. Each campsite has a fire ring and picnic table. There is no electricity and no dump station. A camp host is onsite, and firewood is available.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>The campsites are situated in a spruce forest with wide views of the Brooks Range. Namesake Marion Creek is only a short walk from the campsites. The area provides habitat for squirrels, voles, marten, lynx, wolf, moose, and grizzly and black bears. A variety of birds migrate north to breed in the area and further north. Some of the year-round resident birds include ravens, grouse, chickadees, hawk owls and Canada jays.</p>\n<p>Campers can experience 24-hour daylight during a period of about 30 days around June 21, and abundant light the rest of the summer season.  In late August and into September bright, fall colors in trees and tundra extend for hundreds of miles. Late August and into September, sky gets dark enough that you have chances to see the aurora borealis.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>The original gold rush town of Coldfoot was located on the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk River near the mouth of Slate Creek. It got is name in 1900 when early prospectors reportedly got “cold feet” and left before winter set in.</p>\n<p>Today it is small community serving truckers who drive the “haul road” to Prudhoe Bay, as well as visitors. There is a cafe, lodging, a post office, diesel and gasoline fuel, and limited repair service. Coldfoot is a transition point for people accessing the backcountry via small aircraft.  </p>\n<p>The Arctic Interagency Visitor Center in Coldfoot introduces visitors from around the world to the unique and extreme environment of the Arctic. Explore interpretive exhibits, walk the nearby nature trails, and talk with knowledgeable staff to learn more about the region’s history, natural environment, and recreation opportunities. The visitor center is a partnership between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service (NPS), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The Visitor Center is currently open daily from 11:00 a.m. until 9 p.m. from late May to mid-September, with nightly programs at 8:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>The historic mining village of Wiseman is a few miles to the north. Just after crossing the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk Bridge #1, take the turnoff to the west and follow the signs three miles (5km) to Wiseman. Established in 1907 when miners discovered gold in nearby Nolan Creek, the town was once a bustling community. Many residents today continue to subsist by hunting, trapping, and gardening. They enjoy sharing their stories with visitors. Note that all buildings in the Wiseman area are private property unless noted. Please stay on the roads. </p>\n<p>Travel further north, over Atigun Pass, onto the north slope and coastal plain to experience the dramatic difference from the boreal forest of the Marion Creek Campground area. Landscape is more open, affording chances to see mammals such as Dall’s sheep, muskoxen, caribou, Arctic fox, and Arctic ground squirrels.  Also look for birds such wagtails, wheatears, golden eagles, jaegers, longspurs, shore birds, in breeding plumage.   </p>\n\n<h2>Contact Info</h2>\nThis location has limited staffing.

    "name": "Painted Rock Petroglyph Campground",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Painted Rock Petroglyph Site, approximately 90 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona, provides visitors the opportunity to view an archaeological site containing hundreds of figures and designs carved into rocks, known as petroglyphs. These were produced centuries ago by indigenous peoples. This site is considered important and even sacred to many of the Native American tribes in southern Arizona. Please keep this in mind when you visit and be respectful. Climbing on the rocks is prohibited and we ask that you keep dogs out of the area.There are also inscriptions made by people who passed through during historic times. </p>\n<p>Many important trails are near the site, some of which have been traveled for thousands of years. The 1775 expedition of Juan Bautista de Anza passed nearby on his way to deliver soldiers, padres, settlers, and their livestock to a new home in northern California to secure the area for Spain. In 1846, the Mormon Battalion passed through, following Philip St. George Cooke along some segments of this trail to help secure California from Mexico. This venture included road building tasks along the trail, assuring that future trips could accommodate wagons. A need to improve communication and travel from east to west prompted Congress to fund a stage line. The result was the Butterfield Overland Stage Route, which began service in 1858 and traveled by this site. This mail and freight service guaranteed that the mail, freight, or passengers would be able to travel from Saint Louis to San Francisco in 25 days. Use was halted when the railroad was constructed in 1879.</p>\n<p>Formerly a unit of the Arizona State Park system, jurisdiction of Painted Rock Petroglyph Site returned to the Bureau of Land Management in 1989.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>The day-use site is right next door to the campground and offers two shaded picnic areas and a small interpretive trail around the petroglyph site with informational displays. The petroglyphs face the east-southeast primarily and would have been noticed by any travelers approaching from that direction. Hiking, birdwatching, and star gazing opportunities all present themselves at this site. </p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers visitors 59 individual campsites and two large group sites featuring picnic tables and steel fire rings. There is no water or electric hookups at the campground, but there are two vault toilets and trash collection. The neighboring day-use site has two shaded picnic areas with tables and charcoal grills.</p>\n<p>The path to the Painted Rock Petroglyph Campground is on 11 miles of paved roads with an additional 1/2 mile of a dirt road. All roads in the campground and day-use site consist of hardened dirt and gravel suitable for larger RVs (Class A) and trailers (fifth wheels) when road conditions are dry. This area is prone to flash flooding during monsoon season, so be sure to check the weather before planning your visit.</p>\n\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>Set between impressive geologic features such as Oatman Mountain, a few miles to the northwest  and the Painted Rock Mountains, situated on the eastern horizon, this campground offers scenic panoramic views and plenty of opportunities for solitude and vast night skies. The surrounding area features a diverse Sonoran Desert plant community including the iconic saguaro cactus, various cholla species, barrel cactus, creosote bush, and both ironwood and palo verde trees. The area is home to a large population of desert mule deer and many other desert species such as kit fox, Gambel’s quail, chuckwalla, and desert iguana.</p>\n\n<h2>Contact Info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (602) 867-5400.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p><strong>Woolsey Peak Wilderness</strong></p>\n<p>Woolsey Peak Wilderness offers rugged topography, colorful scenic vistas, rich variety of wildlife and vegetation, and outstanding opportunities for solitude and unconfined recreation. Woolsey Peak stands 3,270 feet above sea level and about 2,500 feet above the Gila River (to the south). The Painted Rock Dam flood- control dam is situated on the Gila River not far from the southwestern corner of the area. Encompassing a major portion of the Gila Bend Mountains, it is barely separated from the smaller Signal Mountain Wilderness to the north. </p>\n<p><strong>Signal Mountain Wilderness</strong></p>\n<p>A narrow, four-wheel-drive road is all that separates Signal Mountain Wilderness from Woolsey Peak Wilderness to the south. Signal Mountain itself, rising just north of the center of the area, reaches a summit of 2,182 feet (1,200 feet above the surrounding desert floor). </p>\n",

Since then, anglers have held high expectations for Pelican Lake. Unfortunately, in 2008 and 2009, adult carp entered Pelican Lake in large numbers and turned the lake from a clear waterbody dominated by largemouth bass and bluegill to a lake dominated by carp. The carp’s ability to outcompete bluegill for food eventually led to a decline in bluegill condition and a few years later, a decline in largemouth bass condition. </p>\n\n<p>The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), and avid Pelican Lake anglers anticipated this decline and convened a working group that developed a management plan for the lakes future success. </p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ouray\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ouray National Wildlife Refuge</a> </p>\n<p>Ouray National Wildlife Refuge lies along the Green River in the Uinta Basin of northeastern Utah.

    "name": "Virgin River Canyon Recreation Area",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>The Virgin River Canyon Recreation Area is located along Interstate 15 approximately 20 miles southwest of St. George, Utah and approximately 20 miles northeast of Mesquite, Nevada. It's accessed from the Cedar Pocket Exit (mile post 18). The overnight-use fee is $8 per site per night and the day-use fee is $2 per vehicle. Overnight use is limited to 14-night stays. The recreation area currently has 25 of the best sites only available through recreation.gov reservations.  The remaining 83 sites are <em>first come, first serve</em> (FF) payable by using the <em>Scan and Pay</em> feature on the recreation.gov app. Please come prepared by either making a reservation here before arrival OR having the <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/mobile-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">recreation.gov app</a> installed with login setup to pay onsite with the <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/mobile-app#scanAndPay\" rel=\"nofollow\">scan and pay</a> option. </p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>The Virgin River Canyon Recreation Area provides many recreational opportunities for hiking, wildlife viewing, water play, and more. It is surrounded by two designated wilderness areas. The Paiute Wilderness east of Interstate 15, and Beaver Dam Mountains Wilderness to the west. The Sullivan Canyon Trail starts within the recreation area and heads into the heart of the Paiute Wilderness. </p><p>The campground and day-use areas also both have scenic trails leading to the Virgin River. The Virgin River is occasionally runable to small whitewater boats during spring runoffs. Please check for information on the fish barriers and flow conditions prior to running.</p><p>Additional opportunities for recreation are available outside of the recreation area. A short drive on the Cedar Pocket Road (directly across the interstate from the campground) leads to the Cedar Pocket Wash Trailhead. This trail leads down a steep path to the narrows of the Cedar Pocket Wash and is a nice short stroll through a Joshua Tree forest. A local trails map is available <a href=\"https://cdn.recreation.gov/public/2025/04/02/03/29/10086109_329de3e6-6123-4efb-88bc-1d2c4fc1fad3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. </p><p>The Virgin River Gorge is also frequented by rock climbers and canyoneers.

Though the Virgin River is relatively small, it is incredibly steep, dropping an average of 70 feet per mile - 10 times steeper than the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. This steepness, caused by the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, has given the Virgin River the ability to cut through sandstone and limestone canyons.  </p>\n<p>The gorge provides a stunning and colorful mountain desert setting. The gorge mimics, on a smaller scale, the colorful layers and striking depths of the Grand Canyon. In fact, many of the very same geologic formations are present in both areas. The gorge connects the southwestern rim of the Colorado Plateau and the northeastern part of the Mojave Desert. </p>\n<p>The climate of the gorge is typical of the Mojave Desert with hot summers and mild winters. This desert climate allows for some of the most northern Joshua Tree populations. The canyon is usually about 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than St George, Utah, however the canyon can occasionally amplify winds.</p>\n<p>Many species depend on the water of the Virgin River. The Virgin River directly supports hundreds of wildlife species including, woundfin, Virgin River chub, Virgin spinedace, flannelmouth sucker, desert sucker, speckled dace, and Southwestern Willow Flycatcher. Many of these species are endangered or are considered sensitive species within the State of Arizona and Utah.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The recreation area has an easy, short paved trail accessed near the fee instruction station. This trail goes up to a Joshua Tree grove and a nice developed viewpoint of the Virgin River Gorge.</li>\n<li>The recreation area also has a trailhead to Sullivan Canyon. This trail crosses the river and traverses 3 miles through wilderness to Sullivan Canyon. </li>\n<li>Follow the high clearance road about 2 miles northwest across from the Virgin River Canyon Recreation Area, you will reach the Cedar Pocket Wash trailhead. Here, there is a short trail to a Joshua Tree grove and plenty of views. A side trail leads steeply down to the wash where you can hike through a limestone slot canyon.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Contact Info</h2>\nThis location is unstaffed.

    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>A short drive up the gravel road that leads to the Bureau of Land Management’s Zapata Falls Campground (CG) will let visitors to the area see the San Luis Valley and Great Sand Dunes National Park & Preserve from a whole new perspective. The campground offers bird’s-eye views of the valley floor below, the San Juan Mountains to the west, the adjacent Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, and several 14er’s and many other towering peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountain range that Zapata Falls CG sits on — not to mention spectacular sunrises, sunsets and night skies!  </p>\n\n<p>Zapata Falls CG has 23 single campsites, 1 group site and 1 camp host site nestled among piñon pines along two one-mile long loops. The sites on one loop are designed for tent campers. Parking spurs on the second loop vary a little in length but in general can handle RVs, towed campers, or other configurations of vehicles up to about 50 feet long.  </p>\n\n<p>A new trailhead in the campground supplies a link to the South Zapata Creek Trail and the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness. A second trail, next door to the campground in the day-use area, leads visitors on a mildly steep half-mile hike to Zapata Falls, which gives the campground its name.</p>\n\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Zapata Falls Recreation Area is a destination known for its waterfall viewing and sweeping vistas of the San Luis Valley, its soaring mountain ranges, and the adjacent Great Sand Dunes National Park. From the waterfall, the trail continues onto the Rio Grande National Forest, for those seeking a backcountry experience in the high country above and the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness. </p>\n<p>Recreation Sites</p>\n<p>•\tStandard Nonelectric</p>\n<p>•\tRv Nonelectric</p>\n<p>•\tGroup Tent Only Area Nonelectric</p>\n<p>•\tOvernight</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>•\tRoad signs from highway to Recreation Area.</p>\n<p>•\tImproved gravel roads in Recreation Area (no pavement).</p>\n<p>•\tNo public drinking water system.</p>\n<p>•\t6 vault (or pit-type) toilets.</p>\n<p>•\tTrash bins throughout campground and day-use areas.</p>\n<p>•\t23 Individual sites (11 Tent, 12 RV, 1 Group Tent, 1 CG Host Site, 7 Picnic sites.</p>\n<p>•\tStandard campground amenities-table, tent pads, fire ring, food storage locker, parking.</p>\n<p>•\tInterpretive, informational, and directional signs.</p>\n<p>•\tTrailhead and overflow parking areas.</p>\n<p>•\tFoot and horse trails.</p>\n<p>•\tAll facilities open year-round.</p>\n<p>•\tCell phone service is good.</p>\n\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>Zapata Falls Special Recreation Management Area</p>\n<p>The Zapata Falls Special Recreation Management Area (SRMA) is rich in history and geology and offers opportunities to hike, camp, mountain bike and view spectacular scenery.  Zapata Falls and the 628 acres surrounding them are State Trust Lands owned by the Colorado State Land Board and are also a designated Colorado Natural Area. They are cooperatively managed with the Bureau of Land Management.</p>\n\n<p>History</p>\n<p>The name “Zapata” is the Spanish word for shoe and is tied to the history of settlement in the San Luis Valley. In 1864, Mexican families established the community of Zapata at the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and raised sheep and other livestock. In the 1870s, cattleman consolidated land holdings and established one of the San Luis Valley’s first and largest cattle ranches know as Zapata Ranch, which remains an active ranch today. </p>\n\n<p>Geology</p>\n<p>Zapata Falls SRMA perches on the edge of an active rift valley.  The San Luis Valley was formed when geologic activity along the Rio Grande Rift, a giant crack in the earth’s top layers, caused the rugged Sangre de Cristo Mountains to rise and the flat plain of the San Luis Valley to sink.  Bedrock lies 5,000 to 13,000 feet below the valley floor, beneath layers of gravel, soil, and water.</p>\n<p>Approximately two million years ago, alpine glaciers inched down the steep slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Water flowing from the glacier and snowfields in the valley above found a weak spot near the end of a moraine – a huge rock pile deposited thousands of years ago by a glacier. For thousands of years, water has carved its path, forming Zapata Falls.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t Take the Plunge at Zapata Falls</p>\n<p>The cold waters of South Zapata Creek drop more than 25 feet through a narrow, rocky canyon.  Please use extreme caution when hiking or wading around the base of Zapata Falls. In spring and summer, the water is cold, the current may be strong, and the rocks are slippery. In winter, climbing to the base of the falls is a slick proposition. Zapata Creek freezes into a sheet of ice blanketed by snow. Beware, the ice may not be thick enough to support your weight. There is no view of the falls from above; trying to climb the rocky walls is dangerous to you and to people below you. The falls are home to the black swift, a rare and elusive bird that nests only in the misty reaches of waterfalls. Stay on the trails to keep from disturbing the birds nesting in the cliffs. </p>\n\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Zapata Falls Trail </p>\n<p>To reach Zapata Falls, you will need to take a short but arduous hike to Zapata Creek. The falls are upstream from where the trail meets the creek. The only way to view the falls is to get your feet wet by wading carefully upstream to the base of the falls.</p>\n<p>Length: 1/2 mile each way</p>\n<p>Elevation: 9,000 to 9,400 feet</p>\n<p>Connections: South Zapata Lake Trail (U.S. Forest Service Trail #852)  </p>\n\n<p>Other Nearby Attractions:</p>\n<p>•\tNPS-Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve.  </p>\n<p>•\tUSFS-Rio Grande National Forest and Sangre de Cristo Wilderness.</p>\n<p>•\tBLM-Blanca Wetlands Recreation Area.</p>\n<p>•\tUSFWS-Baca and Alamosa National Wildlife Refuges.</p>\n<p>•\tGreat Sand Dunes Oasis-Restaurant, gift shop, and lodge (near GRSA Park entrance).</p>\n<p>•\tFt.
