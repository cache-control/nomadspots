    "description": "<p>Just 40 minutes east of the hubbub of Bend, Oregon, sleepy Highway 27 winds 43 miles north from Highway 20 to the city of Prineville. Although the entire route is a state highway, the southernmost 18 miles are unpaved but are of high-standard graded gravel suitable for a passenger vehicle. Private ranches are interspersed among public rangelands with views of rolling hills and towering basaltic buttes. After the paved section begins, the back country byway crosses the spillway of Bowman Dam before descending into the gorge of the Chimney Rock segment of the Crooked Wild and Scenic River with its dozen recreation sites. Here, access to camping, fishing and hiking opportunities are available year-round.<br/>\n </p>\n\n<h4>Know Before You Go:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nine year-round campgrounds, two day-use areas and a hiking trail line the wild and scenic river stretch of this byway.

Historic wagon roads traverse the area; ranching, mining, logging, and homesteading occurred throughout the area in the late 1800's.</p>\n\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The byway includes a variety of remote paved, gravel and earthen surface roads so care should be taken in planning your travels after weather events or during the winter season.</li>\n\t<li>Recreation opportunities along the byway include cite the play area at Virtue Flats OHV area, fishing, boating, swimming, and water-skiing in the Brownlee Reservoir, wildflowers photography in the Snake River Breaks, horseback riding in Rye Valley, and rafting on the Powder River.</li>\n\t<li>On Bureau of Land Management and private lands near the National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, the visible wagon ruts of the Oregon Trail are being protected and preserved for future generations. Please be respectful of private property as you venture along the byway.</li>\n\t<li>Allow for at least five hours of driving time, not including any stops.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>\n\n<p>The Snake River canyons and draws were great hiding places for outlaws, especially on the wilder Idaho side. They could cross the Snake River by rowboat and hide in a cabin in an Idaho canyon, away from the Oregon lawmen. Moonshiners were undisturbed; the locals did not consider it or bootlegging a criminal offense. Counterfeiting also occurred in the canyon draws.</p>\n",

    "name": "Alvord Desert",
    "description": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>While Steens Mountain looms to the west, the shimmering salt flats of the Alvord Desert unfold to the east. Tens of thousands of years ago, a lake almost 200 feet deep covered the Alvord Desert and extended southward into Nevada. The old shoreline forms terraces along the edge of the valley, and deep under the desert floor are the same lava flows that make up the top of Steens Mountain. The Alvord Desert playa can be either wet or dry depending on the time of year and is one of the largest playas in Oregon – six miles wide and 11 miles long. That means plenty of room for setting up a tent and peering up at the stars in the sky! It is a popular venue for land sailing, glider flying, land kiteboarding, and camping, among many other outdoor pursuits.</p><h3>Know Before You Go</h3><ul><li>The Alvord Desert is accessible year-round; however, ideal conditions exist June through November, when the playa is usually dry enough for vehicular travel.</li><li>Do not drive anywhere that is wet or even looks slightly wet. The Alvord Desert playa is made of fine clay sediments that become incredibly slick when damp. What looks like a harmless puddle can quickly turn into thick, sticky mud that will trap your vehicle with little warning. Getting stuck out here is no joke and a tow bill from this remote location can be hefty. Don’t risk it. If in doubt, stay off.</li><li>With no potable water, cell phone service, or designated camping areas, travelers should bring their own conveniences and plan on a barren, open air adventure.</li><li>Bring your own shade, shelter, and water, and tie everything down. Strong winds are common, and weather conditions are often unpredictable.</li><li>The nearest town is Fields, Oregon, approximately one hour south. Food and fuel are available here, however, contact the Fields Station for current hours of operation.</li><li>Pack it out: A single vault restroom at Frog Springs, squeezed between the playa and East Steens Road, is the only public facility available as far as the eye can see. There are NO other amenities. Plan on packing in ONLY what you can pack out – including human and pet waste. Did you know “pack it out” means “pack it all the way out to where you brought it from”? Please recreate responsibly!</li><li>Use permit: Before you set up your own mini-Burning Man event or open-air concert on public land, know that some events and activities – like these – require a special use or film permit. Would you like to hold your wedding, a competitive race or speed event, an overland vehicle rally, a “light show”, or any other large gathering on the Alvord Desert? You may need a special recreation permit. Are you planning a photography shoot, complete with people and/or props, on the Alvord Desert? Do you want to film a commercial, advertisement, or movie clip on public land? You may need a film permit.</li></ul><h3>Point of Interest</h3><p>There are public and private hot springs in the area. The 10-acre Borax Lake and its adjacent hot spring are among the naturally heated water features in the region, though not suitable for swimming due to the area's status as a biological reserve. Borax Lake is a remnant of a once-vast lake ecosystem that stretched across southeastern Oregon. Despite the water carrying an unusually high concentration of dissolved borate, it is home to the endangered Borax Lake chub. Another geothermal site, Mickey Hot Springs, is located approximately 15 miles northeast of the Alvord Desert and worth a visit. While the pools are far too hot for soaking (please keep pets and children a safe distance away), a short walk leads visitors past steam vents, boiling mud pots, and several crystal-blue pools.</p>",

The area reaches a high point on Keynot Peak, at about 11,000 feet, and separates the Owens Valley on the west from the Saline Valley on the east. Most of the eastern border is shared with Death Valley National Park. Year-round streams, some cascading over waterfalls, can be found in eight canyons on the rough east side.

Creosote, shadscale scrub, and sagebrush proliferate at lower elevations. You'll find a lush riparian habitat in the moist canyons, and pinion-juniper woodlands on some of the slopes. Bristlecone and limber pine grow in the higher reaches. Inyo Mountains Wilderness lies partly on BLM land and partly within Inyo National Forest. \n<p> \nA rich mining legacy has left a smattering of ruins to explore, and the towers that supported a men-and-salt-bearing tram from the Saline Valley salt mines to Owens Lake can still be seen on Cerro Gordo Peak. \n<p> \nThere are 103 miles of unmaintained trails, often difficult to follow, a holdover from historic use. Most of these trails are not shown on maps. From Reward, the old Lonesome Miner Trail (40 miles) will take you south through the highest country to Hunter Canyon.

    "description": "\n\n<h2> </h2>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The terrain within the Santa Rosa Mountains Wilderness is rugged with elevations rising dramatically from just above sea level to 7,000 feet. Laced with deep washes and shallow drainages, the area supports a variety of riparian streams which flow year-round. Here, desert and mountain environments blend together to form unique plant habitats, which thrive in riparian oases. The Santa Rosas are strewn with boulders. The steep canyon walls have been eroded by springs and streams.</p>\n\n<p>Bear Creek Oasis, Lost Canyon Oasis, Guadelupe Canyon, Devil Canyon and Rockhouse Canyon are all found within this wilderness. Many of these areas provide important lambing habitat for bighorn sheep. The Santa Rosa Mountains support the largest herd of Peninsular bighorn sheep in the United States. Mule deer can be found throughout the coniferous forests, which grow along the higher elevations of the range. Great horned owls, prairie falcons and golden eagles nest and forage throughout the entire wilderness. Reptiles, including frogs, toads and the desert slender salamander also live in this desert setting.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p><span id=\"cke_bm_308S\"> </span><img alt=\"Martinez Canyon Rockhouse, also called Jack Miller's cabin, in the Santa Rosa Wilderness. One of the sites you can visit in the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Photo by BLM.\" height=\"240\" src=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santarosaandsanjacintomountainsnm-history-temp.jpg\" width=\"320\"/>The Santa Rosa Mountains have been the homeland of hundreds of generations of Cahuilla, whose culture has been described and recorded in numerous publications. Direct evidence links the tribe to this area for at least 3,000 years. Within the Santa Rosas are sacred sites, such as the peak of the Santa Rosa Mountain and Tahquitz Peak, and landscape features which are of great importance to Cahuilla history.</p>\n\n<p>Within the mountain range, Cahulla villages were generally located in or near the mouth of a canyon or in a valley, and in some instances there were both summer and winter villages with the former being at higher elevations and the latter closer to the valley floor. A network of trails connect village sites, campsites, and other areas of importance. Cahuilla lived in the Santa Rosas until the late 19th century, by which time most Cahuilla had moved to nearby reservations or the Coachella Valley, and contemporary Cahuilla have strong feelings and concern for their ancestral homeland.</p>\n\n<p>he Santa Rosas have great heritage value to the Cahuilla and many sites are of National Register quality.

The closure will begin at <strong>6 am Monday, January 6, 2025 and will end at 5 pm on Tuesday, January 7, 2025</strong>. The area is closed to all forms of public access including but not limited to vehicular, pedestrian, and camping activities.

All of the Wilderness is in the state of California. In 1994 the Mecca Hills Wilderness became part of the now over 109 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the restless San Andreas Fault, the geologic formations of Mecca Hills Wilderness are among the most unusual sites of their kind in the world. Entire regions are exposed layers of eroded rock, some over 600 million years old, and are a source of valuable information to scientists about the effects of tremors on the earth's crust. The area is a badlands labyrinth, a natural maze of small, narrow, steep canyons. Colorful Painted Canyon runs in a general north-south path through the middle of the Wilderness. Sandy washes sprinkled with ironwood, smoke trees, and paloverde divide the area, while ocotillo squat on gentler slopes and the tops of mesas. Bighorn sheep occasionally cross over from the Orocopia Mountains on the east, where they find more water. You may see spotted bats, desert tortoises, and prairie falcons.</p>\n\n<p>The non-Wilderness corridor of Box Canyon Road splits off a small southern section of the area in which you'll find Sheep Hole Oasis and Hidden Springs Canyon (reliable sources for water). If you look closely, you'll discover caves, known locally as grottoes.</p>\n\n<h4>Regulations</h4>\n\n<p>In wilderness, you can enjoy challenging recreational activities and extraordinary opportunities for solitude. In an age of \"...increasing population, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization,...\" you play an important role in helping to \"...secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness\" as called for by Congress in the Wilderness Act of 1964. Please follow the regulations in place for this area, and use Leave No Trace techniques when visiting to ensure protection of its unique natural and experiential qualities.</p>\n\n<p>How to follow the seven standard Leave No Trace principles differs in different parts of the country (desert vs. Rocky Mountains). Click on any of the principles listed below to learn more about how they apply. Leave No Trace principles: Plan Ahead and Prepare, Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces, Dispose of Waste Properly, Leave What You Find, Minimize Campfire Impacts, Respect Wildlife, Be Considerate of Other Visitors .</p>\n\n<p>Regulations: Motorized equipment and equipment used for mechanical transport are generally prohibited on all federal lands designated as wilderness.

Elevation ranges from 3200 feet atop Brushy Sky High, down to 600 feet in the eastern end of Cache Creek along State Route 16. Showcasing the area is about 35 miles of the main fork of Cache Creek and 2.5 miles of the north fork.<p>The Cache Creek Natural Area is a primitive area, closed to motorized vehicles. There are no developed campgrounds or facilities. Non-hunting (target) shooting is not allowed. Instead, the area is managed to improve habitat for wildlife and rare plants, to protect cultural resource values, and to offer primitive recreation opportunities, including wildlife viewing, river running, hiking, equestrian use, hunting and fishing. On October 17, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act, designating approximately 27,245 acres within the Cache Creek Natural Area (CCNA) as the Cache Creek Wilderness Area. As a result of this designation, bicycles are not permitted within the designated Wilderness Area.<p> Redbud Trail: From Interstate 5 at Williams, take Highway 20 west about 29 miles to the North Fork Cache Creek/Redbud Trailhead.

Elevations range from 2,300 to 5,500 feet. Because of this elevation gradient, the wilderness reflects a unique transition between desert, coastal and mountain environments, including the different types of vegetation representative of each elevation.</p>\n\n<h4>History</h4>\n\n<p>San Gorgonio Mountain was originally known as \"Old Grayback\" by locals until officially designated by the US Geological Survey (from the Spanish heritage) on the original topographical map of the area produced in 1899. At 11,502 feet, it is the highest peak in California south of the Sierras. The San Gorgonio Wilderness derived its name from this peak within its boundaries. The Wilderness is located in the southeast portion of the San Bernardino Mountains on lands administered by the San Bernardino National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the Wilderness is above the 7,000 foot level. Two rivers (which would be called creeks anywhere but in Southern California), the Santa Ana and the White, flow out of the Wilderness. The numerous streams in the Wilderness Area do not always flow in late summer, and locating water can be difficult. Two small lakes, several meadows, and large, heavily forested areas provide a beautiful sub-alpine oasis in the dry lands that surround the mountain range.</p>\n\n<p>The isolated environment contains many threatened and endangered plant and animal species, as well as bear, deer, mountain lions and bighorn sheep. The summit of the 10,624-foot San Bernardino Peak provided the initial point in 1852 from which all of Southern California was surveyed. There are over 20 miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail in the BLM portion and 81 miles of trails in the National Forest portion of the Wilderness. </p>\n",

Four-wheel-drive roads forge into the area on non-Wilderness intrusions from the east up Horse Canyon and Cow Heaven Canyon, both accessible from State Highway 14. You should be able to find water in numerous springs. However, due to the arid environment and dry conditions be sure to carry plenty of water. Potable drinking water may not be available year round.

Many islands in this region were omitted from the original land surveys conducted in the 1830s and 1840s. Because of this, there is a mixing of ownership between state-owned, privately owned islands. For those under federal management, the BLM administers to almost 500 islands throughout the area.  Because of this varied ownership, it's critical that visitors determine whether an island is public land before using it.<p/><p>The flowages between Stevens Point and Nekoosa are chock-full of more than 60 public islands, ranging from small, low patches of willows and alder, to large stands of mixed pines and hardwoods. Below Castle Rock Lake, the islands down to Prairie du Sac are mostly floodplain forests with broad sandbars that invite paddler-campers. A few of these islands have remnant prairie and savanna vegetation. </p><p>Many public islands are perfect fishing spots, lunch stops for your next float trip, or overnight campsites. However, there are no visitor services at any of these locations; as such, it is important to plan accordingly.  If you have any questions about visiting the islands, please call (414) 297-4400.</p><p>Would you like to volunteer as a BLM public island steward?

Within the Dalton corridor, the BLM maintains campgrounds, rest areas, interpretive panels and the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center in Coldfoot. </p>\n\n<p>Visit the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center website at <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/learn/interpretive-centers/arctic-interagency-visitor-center\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.blm.gov/learn/interpretive-centers/arctic-interagency-visitor-center</a></p>\n\n<h4>Know Before You Go</h4>\n\n<p>This is no ordinary road -- it pays to be prepared. The road is narrow, rough, steep, and mostly gravel -- prone to clouds of dust, slick mud, and sudden potholes. It’s still primarily an industrial corridor, with heavy truck traffic, though drivers also need to keep an eye out for motorcycles, bicyclists, and wildlife crossings. North of Coldfoot, you may encounter snow and ice any month of the year. Lightning-caused wildfires are increasingly common. Cell phone service is extremely limited. Currently, only GCI and AT&T are available in Coldfoot and scattered locations along the highway. There are no medical facilities or grocery stores. </p>\n\n<p>Before you embark on this incredible journey, be sure to check your vehicles tires and fluids, carry extra motor oil and a spare tire(s), and if possible utilize a CB radio tuned to channel 19. Check travel conditions and alerts at <a href=\"https://511.alaska.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">511.alaska.gov</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Recreational Activities</h4>\n\n<p>From hiking to boating, gold panning to wildlife-watching, there are numerous opportunities for recreation alongside the Dalton Hwy. The BLM maintains 4 developed campgrounds, each open late May through early September.

Note that Alaska State statutes prohibits use of off road vehicles, including snowmachines, for 5 miles on either side of the Dalton Hwy, north of the Yukon River. Alaska Department of Fish and Game allows only bow hunting within 5 miles either side of the Dalton Hwy north of the Dalton Hwy as well. </p>\n\n<h4><strong>Pack it In, Pack it Out</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The BLM hauls approximately 20 tons of litter from the Dalton Highway back to Fairbanks (the nearest landfill) each year. Please help reduce waste and litter by packing out everything you pack in.  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n",

It traverses red rock mesas, passes below snow-capped peaks, and fords untamed rivers, avoiding the immense depths of the Grand Canyon and skirting the continent’s harshest deserts.\n\nThe trail takes its name from the Spanish colonies in northern New Mexico and southern California that were linked by this rugged route. The Spanish outpost of Santa Fe, New Mexico was founded in the early 1600s and the pueblo of Los Angeles, California was founded in 1781. But it was not until 1829 when Santa Fe merchant Antonio Armijo led 60 men and 100 pack mules northward on the trails blazed by native peoples that a suitable land passage between these colonies was established. Armijo’s mules carried woolen goods for trade in California. On the return trip, Armijo backtracked along the route Spanish padres Dominguez and Escalante recorded as they returned to Santa Fe from southern Utah more than 50 years earlier. He and his men drove mules, horses, and donkeys obtained in California for trade in New Mexico. Some of the several Old Spanish Trail trade routes were eventually replaced by wagon roads, and many portions of the routes remain today in state highway transportation networks.\n \nThe Old Spanish Trail was designated by Congress as a National Historic Trail in December 2002. By memorandum from the Secretary of the Interior, the Old Spanish National Historic Trail is jointly administered by the BLM and the National Park Service, working in partnership with other federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as private landowners who manage or own lands along the trail route.",

Linking Spain's colonial capital at Mexico City to its northern frontier in distant New Mexico, the route spans three centuries, two countries, and 1,600 miles. It was part of Spain's Camino Real Intercontinental - a global network of roads and maritime routes. </p><p>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro was blazed atop a network of footpaths that connected Mexico's ancient cultures with the equally ancient cultures of the interior West. Starting in Mexico City, the frontier wagon road brought settlers into today's New Mexico. Once travelers crossed the arid lands above Ciudad Chihuahua, they followed the wide Rio Grande Valley north into New Mexico. Many of the historic parajes (campsites) and early settlements created by the Spanish colonists became today's modern cities in the Rio Grande Valley. </p> <p>In the United States, the trail stretched from the El Paso area in Texas, through Las Cruces, Socorro, Belen, Albuquerque, and Santa Fe to Ohkay Owingeh (San Juan Pueblo), the first Spanish capital in New Mexico. In Mexico, the historic road runs through Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potos?, Aguascalientes, Guanajuato, and Quer?taro to Mexico City. </p> <p>Today, the trail corridor nurtures a lively exchange of ideas, customs, and language between Mexico and the American Southwest.</p><h2>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail Partnership</h2><p>Our national historic trails commemorate events and processes that shaped our Nation. While it is possible to follow the general route of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro today on modern highways in New Mexico and Texas, many miles of the Trail cross private lands and many of the most significant trail sites are privately owned or managed by tribal, state, or municipal agencies. We work closely with the National Park Service (www.nps.gov/elca) to administer the trail and with the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Trail Association (CARTA) (www.caminorealcarta.org) to develop volunteer opportunities and projects along the trail. Contact our many partners for information about the trail and opportunities to visit trail sites.</p><h2>Respect the Trail</h2><p>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro runs through the heart of the Rio Grande Valley. The historic road was added to our National Trails System in 2000 as El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail. The trail is administered jointly by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. These agencies work in close partnership with El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Trail Association (CARTA), the Native Americans whose ancestors first encountered the Spanish colonists, and a large network of state, county, and municipal governmental agencies, private landowners, nonprofit heritage conservation groups, and many others. Trail sites are in private, municipal, tribal, federal or state ownership. Please ask for permission before visiting any trail sites on private lands and check with public sites for visiting hours and regulations.</p><h2>Places To Go</h2><p>There are many places of history and commemoration on El Camino Real for you to visit. All of these sites participate in El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail.

Honeycombs WSA contains outstanding opportunities for primitive and unconfined recreation, ranging from passive activities to those requiring much physical exertion and endurance. The opportunities for trapping furbearers and hunting deer and antelope are widespread in the WSA. The quality of deer hunting is greater because the topography and vegetation creates habitat more favorable to deer. Outstanding opportunities for solitude exist because the rugged terrain, steep-sided hills and winding drainages limit sight distances. Resources in the WSA also support activities such as nature study, photography, rock hounding, bird watching, and sightseeing. The colorful and heavily eroded Willwood Formation provides an excellent opportunity for geologic study.",

    "description": "The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCNST or PCT for short) is a continuous hiking and equestrian route extending 2,600 miles from Canada to Mexico. It passes through 23 national forests (including several wilderness areas), 7 national parks, other Federal lands, and numerous portions of State, local, tribal, and private lands. It was established as part of the national system of recreational and scenic trails under the National Trails System Act of 1968. Elevations along the trail range from 500 feet near Whitewater to just below 13,200 feet near Mount Whitney in the Sierra Nevada. Open to nonmechanized use only, the trail is a popular journey for backpackers. In southern California, winter and spring are generally the best times to travel, when daytime temperatures remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, spring rains bring out the wildflowers, and splashes of green accent the oak-chaparral foothills. Trailheads can be accessed at the top of Walker Pass on State Highway 178, at Bird Springs Pass off of designated route SC120 within the Jawbone-Butterbredt ACEC, and at the Chimney Creek Campground on the eastern side of the Chimney Peak Wilderness. The Owens Peak Segment begins at Walker Pass in Kern County, and extends 41 miles north to the Sequoia National Forest at Rockhouse Basin within the Domelands Wilderness.  Elevations range from 5,245 feet at Walker Pass to 7,900 feet on Bear Mountain. The trail offers spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.",

It provides a host of outdoor recreation opportunities including three developed campgrounds, a picnic area, several hiking trails, and a snowmobile/ATV trail leading up into the Shoshone National Forest.  \n<br><br>\nThe canyon abounds with wildlife--mule deer, bighorn sheep, and wintering moose and elk. Raptors nest in the canyon cliffs. The Middle Fork of the Popo Agie provides great habitat for rainbow trout.  \n<br><br> \nRecreation opportunities include sightseeing, hiking, rock climbing, fishing, picnicking, and hunting. Perhaps the most notable attraction is the Sinks itself, from which the canyon takes its name. At the Sinks, the Popo Agie River literally sinks underground and reappears several hundred yards below at the appropriately-named Rise. One of the canyon's most popular attractions, a large pool of huge trout, is found at the Rise. You can watch and feed the fish, but fishing is not allowed there.  \n<br><br> \nRock climbers come from around the world to hone their skills on the canyon's sheer walls of Bighorn dolomite. The walls' southern exposure means they're warmed by direct sunlight, providing year-round climbing opportunities. Three hiking trails lead to the base of the cliffs.  \n<br><br> \nMuch of the canyon is comprised of public lands, managed by the USDA Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and by the State of Wyoming at Sinks Canyon State Park. Additional information is available at the Sinks Canyon Visitor Center which is open from May through September.\n",

Travel graveled roads to Atlantic City, South Pass City State Historic Site, the ghost town of Miner's Delight, or ride along two-track roads through stands of pine and aspen. <br><br> The many possible rides in the area include the 11-mile Ft. Stambaugh Loop Road (BLM 2324), including Miner's Delight, and all day rides taking in Atlantic City and South Pass City State Historic Site. You can view various wildlife along the way, including pronghorn, deer, elk, moose and raptors.<br><br> HISTORY <br><br> During the 1800s, Wyoming became the focus for American expansion into the trans-Mississippi west. Robert Stuart’s discovery of South Pass in October 1812 gave hope that a practical overland route to the Pacific (the route Lewis and Clark searched for but failed to find) did exist. <br><br> By 1824, South Pass was in annual use by mountain men and trappers engaged in the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade. Soon trappers discovered connections that linked South Pass with the Snake and Columbia rivers and with the Hudson’s Bay Company holdings of the Pacific Northwest. <br> <br> Some 150,000 pioneers went west between the years of 1849 and 1852. By the mid-1850s, stage coaches and freight wagons were regular users of the California, Mormon Pioneer and Oregon trails, rolling both east and west through South Pass. For 19 months in 1860-61, the riders of the Pony Express transcontinental mail service thundered through the pass on an incredible schedule covering 2,000 miles from St. Joseph, Missouri, to San Francisco, California, in 10 days or less. <br><br> Historians estimate that some 500,000 pioneers “went westering” along the South Pass trail system before the great overland wagon train migrations slowed down with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. About 80,000 were headed for the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Some 70,000 Mormons had the Great Salt Lake region as their destination. Most of the remaining 350,000 were bound for California with just a few headed for intermediate destinations. Of those that started the journey, one in 10 would not complete it. Thousands would die along the way, mostly from accidents, cholera and other diseases. Some would simply get to their destination and turn back. ",

Exposed fissures, lava fields, lava tubes, craters and cinder cones form a strangely beautiful volcanic sea on central Idaho's Snake River Plain. This landscape was formed by eruptions that started 15,000 years ago and represents the last period of volcanic activity in this area. The most recent activity occurred just 2,100 years ago, and is likely to continue. Craters of the Moon offers countless opportunities for hiking, camping, cross-country skiing, wildlife viewing and backcountry travel. For casual travelers the seven-mile Loop Road and trails in the National Park Service Monument and Preserve provide easy access to this weird and scenic landscape. A network of primitive roads in the BLM backcountry offer driving and exploration opportunities for motorists with high-clearance, 4-wheel-drive vehicles.\nNote: All camping facilities are managed by the National Park Service's Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve.

Picture Canyon (a spring location and major wash) transects the wilderness in the north and the Piute Wash borders the wilderness on the west.  Vegetation is predominantly creosote bush desert scrub and desert wash scrub.  The northern most occurrence of smoketrees in the California Desert Conservation Area (CDCA) is found within the area's washes.  Wildlife is typical for the Mojave Desert; including a small herd of bighorn sheep, coyote, black-tailed jackrabbits, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, roadrunners, chucker, quail, prairie falcons, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, rattlesnakes, and several species of lizards.  The eastern and northeastern portions of the wilderness provide critical habitat for the threatened desert tortoise.  The wilderness is located along the eastern border of the sector and consists of 47,157 acres.  The wilderness is easily accessible on all sides by BLM routes and OHV intrusions are common along the eastern and northern boundaries.  The wilderness borders Nevada and receives visitation from people at camp sites just across the state line.  Also, the wilderness area had several existing right-of-way roads along its eastern boundary when it was established.  These roads have continued to be used by the right-of-way holders and the public.\n\nPlease follow the regulations in place for this area, and use Leave No Trace techniques when visiting to ensure protection of its unique natural and experiential qualities.<p>How to follow the seven standard Leave No Trace principles differs in different parts of the country (desert vs. Rocky Mountains).

The rivers of the Owyhee and Bruneau-Jarbidge systems offer something for nearly every level of boating experience. The Owyhee and Bruneau-Jarbidge river systems provide visitors with unsurpassed solitude in canyons of unique beauty and form. From placid pools to turbulent whitewater; from vertical cliffs to steep grassy slopes; and from wildlife, such as California bighorn sheep to wildflowers, including the Bruneau River flox, these rivers and their canyons present visitors with challenging and extraordinary experiences. The rivers offer challenging whitewater boating in an isolated setting. The canyons and plateau provide ample opportunity for those who wish to explore the area on foot. Sportsmen will find excellent fishing for trout and hunting for upland birds and some big game. The truly adventurous can explore 180,000 acres of pristine lands in two nearby Wilderness Study Areas. The upper canyon is the most scenic part and the easiest floating. Boaters can take out near the scenic overlook at Rogerson, but you have to climb out of the steep canyon. The second half, through Five Mile Rapids and Hot Springs Creek is rocky and requires a lot of maneuvering. Only experienced boaters should attempt the lower part of the Bruneau, especially at high water. The drive to the put-in is an experience in itself, and you should be prepared. Go with someone who knows the way, or hire a shuttle driver in Bruneau. From the confluence of the two rivers to south of Bruneau is 56 miles of class II-IV rapids.</p>\n",

    "description": "Congress established the Nez Perce National Nez Perce National Historic Trail Historic Trail in 1986. It stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, across Idaho to the Bear Paw National Historic Trail in Chinook, Montana.\n\nBefore and after Lewis and Clark, the Nez Perce homeland extended throughout central Idaho, northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Here, the Nez Perce hunted, fished, collected camas and biscuitroot, and raised their children passing on knowledge acquired over millennia.\n\nAs fur trappers, traders, settlers, soldiers, missionaries, and farmers moved into or through the area, the Nez Perce and their lands underwent some very big changes. Tensions increased between the Nez Perce and these new people.  Anxious to avoid conflict, the Nez Perce signed a treaty to create a large reservation encompassing their traditional homeland. After gold was discovered inside the reservation in 1863 and as miners and settlers moved in to the reservation, a new treaty reduced the original reservation by 90 percent.\n\nSome tribal leaders rejected the new treaty. In May of 1877, the U.S. government ordered the “non-treaty” Nez Perce to relocate to the new reservation by June 14. After violence erupted, Chief Joseph and other Nez Perce leaders, including Toohoolhoolzote, decided it would be better to flee to Canada than to relocate to the reduced reservation. In 1877, 750 Nez Perce—two-thirds of them women, children, the elderly and the sick and with 2,000 of their own horses—battled and eluded more than 2,000 U.S. Army soldiers and other pursuers over 1,100 miles. They finally surrendered at Bear Paw, Montana, just shy of the Canadian border.",

More than 1,000 miles of trail ruts and traces can still be seen across 10 states along this historic trail.\n\nIn 1849, gold was discovered at Sutter's Fort near Sacramento, California, setting off a rush by miners and others seeking  free  land in California.  By 1869, more than a quarter of a million people crossed the plains and mountains heading to the West to find gold and claim free land.\n \nThe California Trail offered several paths to the West Coast and California. One of the primary routes ran through South Pass, Wyoming, which then led California-bound pioneers through southeast Idaho.  Another route led to Salt Lake City and then northward to Idaho to rejoin the main trail at the City of Rocks near Granite Pass.\n\nBy the 1860s, freight and mail companies, military expeditions, new settlements and trading stations, and thousands of travelers headed in all directions had transformed the California Trail into a road.  But, in 1869, the Union Pacific Railroad was connected with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Point in northern Utah, making it possible to travel across the nation by rail   ushering in a new era in transportation and heralding the end of long-distance travel by wagon through the West. \n\n",

Captain Lewis collected three new plant species in this area: mountain maple, common snowberry and Lewis's monkey flower. You might see elk, mule and whitetail deer, black bear, moose, pronghorn antelope, coyotes and many smaller mammal species. Early mornings and evenings are the times to look for wildlife, particularly where the forest and meadow meet. By late September shorter days and cooler temperatures release hues of red, yellow, and gold in aspens, cottonwoods, willows and shrubs. Don t miss Agency Creek in October   it's beautiful!",

This area’s exceptional riding opportunities provide riders with smooth riding opportunities through rolling sage hills set against the equally stunning backdrops of the Continental Divide and Salmon River valley. The trails are generally smooth and fast and not too technically challenging, which results in great opportunities for riders of all skill and ability levels. The nearby Sacajawea Motorsports Park operated by Lemhi County offers excellent opportunities for motorized recreation. Visitors to the area can also walk portions of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and experience a landscape largely unchanged since the Corps of Discovery passed through the area in 1805. Although this trail system is a popular destination for year-round riding, it is often snow-covered in the winter, and users are asked not to ride during the wet and muddy conditions of spring thaw to protect the trails.",

A very short segment of stream in Bear Trap Canyon is designated as wild in the National Wild and Scenic River System. Beartrap Wilderness is an isolated parcel of land managed by the BLM. While its western boundary is contiguous with Zion National Park, its northern, southern, and eastern boundary borders private land. The terrain within its 40 acres consists of a sandstone finger of a mesa and the upper reach of the Beartrap Canyon. At a top elevation of 7,500 feet, both the mesa top and canyon bottom sustains Utah juniper and ponderosa and pinyon pine trees. Despite its small size, but because of its proximity to adjacent wilderness and other relatively undisturbed lands, a wide variety of wildlife lives here. Hawks, falcons, and eagles soar above the canyons, while ringtailed cats, mountain lion, and black bear hunt in the uplands and along the canyon bottoms. The dissected remote canyons also offer suitable nesting habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, a threatened species.",

    "name": "Milner Historic Recreation Area",
    "description": "<p>Over 100 years ago, emigrants on the Oregon Trail passed through what is now the Milner Historic Recreation Area, creating ruts as they traveled through the soft soil of the area. Some of the emigrants chose to camp here, resting before continuing the long journey ahead. The historic recreation area preserves these still visible Oregon Trail ruts. Just north of the recreation area's west entrance is an interpretive shelter and a hiking trail that leads to some of the Oregon Trail ruts. Centered within the historic recreation area is a 1.3-mile paved ADA walking path that follows the historic ruts with interpretive panels along the way discussing the history of the area. Milner Historic Recreation Area also offers ample opportunities for recreation, including four miles of Snake River shoreline making it the largest accessible section of public land along the river in the entire Magic Valley. Enjoying this shoreline is made easier with access to two boat ramps within the recreation area, one of which includes a kayak/canoe launch to assist in use of non-motorized watercraft. Fishing the Snake River for bass, perch, catfish, trout and carp is popular whether from boat or shore. The area's basalt cliffs and surrounding sagebrush/grassland are a year-round haven for songbirds, waterfowl, upland birds, rabbits, and reptiles. Mule deer can often be seen along the tree lines and near the river. Scattered through the historic recreation area are 26 campsites with moderate development such as fire rings, picnic tables and vault toilets located nearby. Some campsites situated near the river's edge have docks from which campers can swim, fish or boat. One of the boat ramps includes a picnic area with shade structures, picnic tables, grills, and horseshoe pits. This is a US fee site that currently has a $5 day use fee and $15 per night camping fee to include 2 vehicles. Additional vehicles will be charged $5 per night per vehicle. Annual passes are available by contacting the Burley Field Office. Idaho State Park Passes are not accepted. No reservations are available, and all sites are first come, first served. Camping allowed only in numbered and designated sites. Currently no water, electric hook ups, or dump station on site. RV's and large trailers are recommended to use the west entrance into the historic recreation area due to low clearance on the east end. While there are camp sites that can accommodate larger RV's, not all sites are RV friendly, enter with caution. Bring your own firewood as cutting of vegetation on site is prohibited. Shooting of firearms is prohibited within 100 yards of any picnic, camping, scenic viewing, boat ramp, or gathering site. Annual Pass: $50 for unlimited day use at Milner Historic Recreation Area and Lud Drexler Park. Reduces camping rate to $5 per site per night, to include two vehicles. Available at the Burley Field Office and Twin Falls District Office. </p>\n",

With its twisting passages and striking descents, Birch Hollow offers canyoneers a superlative day trip. The route requires technical canyoneering skills and equipment, with rappels of up to 120 feet (40 meters).</p><p>Birch Hollow is undeveloped, with no designated trails or amenities. Most visitors begin at the Birch Hollow kiosk on North Fork Road. From the kiosk, an unmaintained path leads about a mile to the first rappel. Alternatively, a user-created bypass route can be used to avoid the first drop. The route continues downcanyon through a series of rappels before reaching the confluence with Orderville Canyon. From here, most visitors exit the canyon system by hiking upstream to the Orderville Canyon trailhead and shuttling back to the Birch Hollow kiosk. Alternative user-identified routes can eliminate the need for a shuttle, but they require good route-finding skills and are often difficult to follow. Some visitors opt to hike downcanyon in Orderville Canyon into Zion National Park, ultimately exiting the canyon system by way of the Virgin River Narrows. This route requires additional rappels and a Zion National Park canyoneering permit. It makes for an extremely long day hike that should not be underestimated.</p><p>Birch Hollow is critical habitat for the threatened Mexican spotted owl and contains other important resources such as wilderness character. <b>Limit group size to 12 people or fewer</b> to minimize impacts to wildlife and other resources. If you have a larger group, break it up and allow at least a 30-minute buffer between groups.</p><p><b>Please do your part to protect Orderville Canyon Wilderness Study Area by following Leave No Trace principles: </b></p><p>Plan ahead and prepare to ensure that you have detailed route information as well as proper skills and equipment. Bring all supplies, including drinking water, with you. Be self-sufficient and don’t expect others to rescue you in an emergency.</p><p>Dispose of waste properly and packing out what you pack in.</p><p>Protect soils and vegetation by traveling on durable surfaces and staying low in the drainage as you hike.</p><p>Leave what you find, and don’t mark rock faces or disturb vegetation. Adding bolts or chains or other climbing equipment is prohibited.</p><p>Respect wildlife by maintaining your distance and not harassing or feeding wild animals.</p><p>Be considerate of other visitors by keeping noise down and allowing faster groups to pass you in the canyon to avoid bottlenecks at obstacles.</p><p><b>Know before you go: </b></p><p>Slot canyons like Birch Hollow are flood prone and should not be attempted if there is a risk of rain or flash flooding.</p><p>Attempting to access the trailheads for Birch Hollow and Orderville Canyon by passenger car is not recommended. The unpaved portion of North Fork Road is clay based and quickly becomes impassable to even 4-wheel-drive vehicles when wet.</p>",

The remainder of the Bartleson-Bidwell party determined to continue to California and headed west along the north shore of the Great Salt Lake. The route was entirely unknown and water sources were scarce. Finally crossing the desert west of the lake near Wendover, Nevada, they were forced to abandon their wagons. Accompanied by their surviving animals, they eventually found their way through the Ruby Mountains to the Humboldt River and ascended the Sierra Nevada Mountains near the Walker River into California.

The WSA is 3,767 acres in size and lies on the boundary of Beaver and Iron counties in western Utah, approximately 50 miles west of Cedar City. Originally, the White Rock Range WSA was 24,065 acres in size and straddled the border of Nevada and Utah. In 2004, the Nevada portion was designated as wilderness under the Lincoln County Conservation Recreation Development Act. Adjacent lands in Utah continue to be managed as a WSA by the Cedar City BLM Field Office. The WSA and surrounding lands consist of gentle mountain terrain with associated foothills and benches. Many side canyons and drainages exist throughout the range offer opportunities for exploration. Vegetation consists mostly of pinyon-juniper woodland and fir depending on elevation which ranges from approximately 6,200 to over 9,000 feet. Interspersed throughout the area are numerous small grassy meadows where springs support riparian vegetation. Notable wildlife found in the White Rock Range WSA include cougar, bobcat, badger, jackrabbit, along with several bird and reptile species, as well as a large elk herd and mule deer herd. The White Rock Range is primitive in the most literal sense. Virtually untouched by human activity, the area has the capacity to accommodate large numbers of visitors while still maintaining solitude due to the heavy tree cover and jumbled mountain topography. The volcanic nature of the geology results in strangely beautiful peaks that tower above a sea of green trees offering expansive views of surrounding basins and ranges. Solitude, lands unaffected by outside influences, and the opportunity for primitive recreation combine with the abundance of natural springs to make this area an ideal destination for the avid outdoors person.",

The Dark Canyon drainage is primarily administered by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The Forest Service manages the upper end of the canyon as the 45,000 acre Dark Canyon Wilderness Area and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers the lower end of the canyon as the 62,000 acre Dark Canyon Primitive Area /Wilderness Study Area (WSA) and as a Special Recreation Management Area (SRMA). The extreme lower end of Dark Canyon is within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, administered by the National Park Service. </p> The Dark Canyon SRMA/Primitive Area includes the side canyons of Dark Canyon and smaller canyons in the area. Fable Valley is a shallower canyon about eight miles long north of Dark Canyon that is part of this area. </p>The Primitive Area/WSA also includes areas of the Dark Canyon Plateau between the canyons, which offers a canyon rim oriented visitor experience. North of Fable Valley is a smaller rugged area managed as the Dark Canyon Natural Area, which is a non-WSA area with Wilderness Characteristics. </p>Dark Canyon is a very rugged area, and many of the trails are very strenuous. Visitors should be well prepared for extreme conditions.",

With the mountainous topography and large size, there are many good opportunities to enjoy solitude, wildlands, and primitive recreation. The Cedar Mountain Wilderness provides visitors with an excellent example of the Great Basin ecosystem that stretches from the Wasatch Front in Utah to the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. This arid desert mountain range forms the western boundary of Skull Valley and got its name from the area's juniper trees which are sometimes referred to as cedars. Vegetation in the Cedar Mountains transitions rapidly from Great Basin salt desert shrub covered benches at 4,600 feet to sagebrush/juniper woodlands and native bunch grasses at elevations over 6,000 feet. Topography generally consists of flat plains and benches that rise rapidly to higher elevations characterized by steep slopes and canyons. Maximum elevation is 7700 feet. The wilderness area is long and narrow, running north to south for 32 miles along the length of the Cedar Mountains with a maximum width of only 7 miles. There are natural springs that support both native wildlife, livestock, and a thriving herd of wild horses.",

The trail climbs the Vermilion Cliffs to an alcove filled with unique, approximately 870- to 1,070-year-old petroglyphs that have been pecked and carved into the alcove’s sloping, sandstone floor.</p><p>From the trailhead, the Mansard Trail ascends approximately 950 feet over a series of switchbacks, offering increasingly sweeping views of Kanab and the plateaus of northern Arizona. As the trail reaches the top of the Vermilion Cliffs, it negotiates a short section of rough stone slabs, which may require a mild scramble. From here, the trail crosses the sandy plateau to arrive at the base of the White Cliffs, where a scenic alcove contains petroglyphs from the Pueblo II period (AD 950 to 1150).</p><p>Native American groups identify images like these as “rock writing,” because they were a form of communication rather than decoration. <b>Respect and protect rock writing and archaeological sites:</b><p/><p><b>Keep discovery alive.</b> Archaeological sites are fragile and irreplaceable. Treat sites with the respect they deserve so that future generations can experience these direct links to the past.<p><b>Don’t touch rock writing or make your own.</b> Never touch, deface, trace, slide on, or otherwise damage rock writing. Direct contact with rock surfaces causes the images to deteriorate, permanently erasing them and destroying the experience for future visitors. Do not make your own markings or signatures on any of the rock surfaces around the site. Leave the sand where it is – don’t dig holes or brush off the rock writing panel. <b>Vandalism, damage, defacement, or removal of any artifact or rock writing image on public lands is illegal and can result in fines or imprisonment.</b></p><p><b>Watch your step.</b> Do not step or climb on the rock surface in the alcove. Take care not to cause damage with hiking poles.</p><p><b>Don’t camp, eat, or go to the bathroom near the site.</b> Camping, fires, food, and human waste damage archaeological remains and spoil the view for other visitors.</p><p><b>Teach kids respect.</b> Archeological sites are not playgrounds. Please teach children to be respectful visitors and keep an eye out to prevent them from getting hurt or accidentally damaging sites.</p><p><b>Keep dogs on leash.</b> Pets should be leashed and kept away from the alcove to prevent damage, digging, or other impacts to the site. Please clean up and pack out pet waste.</p><p><b>Report vandalism or damage.</b> Help protect your public lands. If you notice damage or see vandalism occurring, please notify the BLM Kanab Field Office at 435-644-1200 or the Kane County Sheriff's Department at 435-644-4916.</p><p>The Mansard Trail is best suited to foot traffic only; horses are allowed but may find the stone scramble to be a serious obstacle. Dogs are allowed but may require assistance in the steep section. Please keep them away from the rock art and pack out their waste. Bicycles and motorized vehicles are not allowed on the Mansard Trail, but ATVs may access the site via BLM104, a challenging four-wheel-drive road. The Mansard Trailhead includes a graveled parking area but no other amenities. For more information and detailed maps, visit the Kanab Visitor Center (BLM) in Kanab, UT.</p>",

Upon returning home from the war he learned that his girlfriend left and married another man. Heart broke he decided to travel to Delta Utah to visit his brother in 1929. While making his way through the Marjum Pass just 45 miles from Delta Utah; Bob's house on wheels broke down. Looking for shelter Bob located a small natural cave in the side of a canyon. By using local rock, he enclosed the front of the cave which is now known as the Hermit's Cave House, or Hermit's Cabin. Bob was often called the Hermit of Marjum Pass. The government paid him to keep the pass clear of debris, as it was at the time the major east/west highway from Delta to Nevada. To earn extra spending money he trapped bobcats and coyotes, mixed poisons for the government to kill grasshoppers, and he even raised a handful of sheep. When Bob would have visitors, out of the greatness of his heart, he would offer them a glass of home brew. In 1951 Bob lost his road job when the new paved highway was built several miles to the south. Bob, then in his 70's, moved into Delta to be near a few more creature comforts. At the age of 80 when Bob passed away he was cremated and his ashes were spread at the base of the rock house he built in Marjum Pass. Please protect the Hermit's Cave for many more generations. Please don't lean on the walls and don't leave your mark in anyway. Always pack out your trash.",

This route was first pioneered by the Fremont expedition in 1845 and promoted a year later by the ambitious Lansford W. Hastings as a shorter route to the Humboldt River in Nevada. However, the Hastings Cutoff involved a perilous 90-mile waterless trek across the Great Salt Lake Desert sand dunes and mud flats in mid-summer heat with heavy wagons. Donner-Reed Pass is located on the last 10 miles of this arduous crossing before reaching fresh water at Donner Spring. In this area, many emigrant parties lost valuable livestock and wagons to the punishing desert heat. This was the last agonizing stretch for emigrants crossing the Great Salt Lake Desert.",

It flows northwest from Palisades Dam in Swan Valley. For the first nine miles, the river runs through a narrow channel, then widens and flows around several island complexes. A waterfall can be seen just upstream from the Swan Valley Bridge where Fall Creek cascades into the river. Downstream of Conant launch the river leaves Highway 26 and enters a scenic canyon. The impressive canyon scenery continues downstream until near Heise Hot Springs, where the cliffs give way to a level, but extremely dynamic, flood plain. \n\nThe South Fork supports the largest riparian cottonwood gallery forest in the West and is among the most unique and diverse ecosystems in Idaho. It is also home to 126 bird species, including 21 raptors, meriting a \"National Important Bird Area\" designation. The river also supports the largest native cutthroat fishery outside of Yellowstone National Park. The corridor is also home for an impressive array of other wildlife including moose, deer, elk, mountain goats, mountain lions, black bears, bobcats, coyotes, river otter, beaver, fox, and mink. \n\nThe South Fork is also located near some of the world's best known recreation areas including Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Island Park, Targhee National Forest, Teton River, Henrys Lake State Park and the Henry's Fork of the Snake River. Among recreationists throughout the country, the South Fork is known as a premier blue ribbon trout fishery, and was selected as the host site for the 1997 World Fly-Fishing Championship. More than 300,000 anglers, campers, hikers, boaters and other recreationists use the South Fork each year. \n\nNumerous hiking trails start near the South Fork. The Canyon Rim Trail begins in Black Canyon and follows the canyon upriver to Dry Canyon, providing magnificent views of the river below. A variety of trails exist on the Targhee National Forest in the Swan Valley area and along the South Fork. Some of these trails are available for mountain biking and off-highway vehicles. \n\nThe river is eligible for inclusion in the nation's Wild and Scenic river system. Land ownership in the corridor is a mixture of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDF&G), State of Idaho, counties, and private interests.

The crystals formed within cavities of the Topaz Mountain rhyolite, a volcanic rock which erupted approximately six to seven million years ago from volcanic vents along faults in the area. Topaz Mountain is one of the world's great places to find topaz. If you search the washes and slopes on the south side of the mountain you will find small topaz crystals glimmering in the sunlight. If you search seams in the rhyolite, you may find gem-quality crystals. Topaz Mountain is located in a remote area where there is no water and no services are provided. You should always carry food, plenty of water, tools and emergency equipment. To dig the topaz, helpful tools include a rock hammer or regular hammer, screw driver, bags for your gems, hiking boots, hat, sun screen, bug repellant and once again don t forget the water! Jeans are a wise choice since while you are digging you are often on your knees on the rough and jagged rocks.",

Indian Creek has something to offer everybody: rock climbers come to test their skills on world-class crack climbing routes, bird watchers scan high cliffs for Golden Eagles and Peregrine Falcons, and photographers seek to capture the moment when late afternoon light illuminates canyons in a vibrant red. Whether you stop at Newspaper Rock for a few minutes or stay at one of Indian Creek’s three established campgrounds, you are sure to find something in this magnificent landscape that speaks to you. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h4>Climbing</h4>\n\n<p>Rock climbing is a popular recreation activity in Indian Creek. There are thousands of crack climbs to choose from, but very few routes for beginners: if you plan to climb in Indian Creek, be prepared for the challenges that unrelenting splitter crack-climbing presents. Remember to recreate responsibly so that future generations can enjoy the same experience. Please keep these tips in mind while exploring the climbs of Indian Creek: </p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Wait at least 24-48 hours to climb on sandstone following rain.</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Wet sandstone can erode more quickly and could result in weakened anchors, cam slipping, and unintentional changes in the climbing route.  </p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Use existing trails and respect private property.</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Several popular climbs can only be reached by crossing private land. Unless signs say otherwise, leave gates open or closed as you find them. </p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Don’t bust the crust.</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Cryptobiotic soil is a living crust that plays an important ecological role in many desert environments. When you or your animal walks on crust, it can take decades to regrow.  </p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Pack out human waste.</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Desert soil lacks the necessary microorganisms for it to biodegrade naturally.  </p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Visit archeological sites with respect.</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Please <a href=\"https://www.friendsofcedarmesa.org/tips-for-visiting-with-respect/\" rel=\"nofollow\">visit archeological sites with respect</a>. It is illegal to damage, disturb or remove anything from archeological or historical sites.  </p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Respect raptor avoidance areas.</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Golden Eagles and Peregrine Falcons make their homes in the cliffs of Indian Creek: disturbing them can impact their young and present a dangerous situation for a climber if a raptor feels threatened. <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-lifts-voluntary-climbing-avoidance-areas-indian-creek\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raptor avoidance areas</a> are typically active through the summer, but they are lifted based on the behavior of raptors each year and therefore may vary.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>You can learn more about how to minimize your impact while climbing in Indian Creek by contacting the Monticello Field Office (435-587-1500).  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h4>Camping</h4>\n\n<p>What could be better than sleeping underneath the expansive, starry skies of canyon country? There are two options for camping on your visit to Indian Creek: camping at an established campground or dispersed camping.  </p>\n\n<p>Indian Creek is home to three of Bears Ears National Monument’s established campgrounds: <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/10214768\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hamburger Rock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/10214673\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superbowl</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/10214735\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creek Pasture</a>. These campsites are first-come, first-served, the cost $15/night and the maximum stay is 14 days. All of the first-come, first-served sites allow for Scan & Pay, so you can pay electronically through the Recreation.gov mobile app once you have claimed an available site. Group sites are available for reservation and can be found at the <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/252280\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indian Creek Falls Group Site</a>, <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/257007\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superbowl Group Site</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/252281\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creek Pasture Group Site</a>. All group sites can accommodate up to 50 people and cost $65/night. </p>\n\n<p>Dispersed camping is allowed 150 feet off designated routes in Indian Creek in previously disturbed areas. Pack out all trash. Protect and conserve scarce desert water sources by camping at least 300 feet from water sources or streams to allow for wildlife access.  </p>\n",

The Northern Paiute trail through High Rock Canyon was first recorded by a Euro-American, Captain John Fremont, in 1844. The Applegate brothers guided emigrant wagon trains through the canyon on their way to Oregon's Willamette Valley. In 1849 and into the 1850's it was a well beaten path to the gold fields and towns of California. But today it is far off the beaten path and that fact makes it a particularly special place. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mypubliclands/36742285895/in/photolist-XYMPvR-K5jBoH-uTBjtY-UNLTef-qVz7ca-UsSShM-WH4PoN-xBUXWM-2k5V4zq-qfYXYE-vy1Gwf-ptnLut-pt6tz4-uM9XY7-Ku2TSq-vQEhWp-qgcb7n-vR3j1F-qfYWK7-qrnPn9-K5jBEK-UsSQLR-2k5Lnu8-qrnPi1-zDmHQW-qVz6d6-uMkb3r-pS9FkB-qNLus6-rBoGVq-xCKqqn-s2qh5M-DZwucf-2k5V332-xS6A87-xTy8dG-xQYoAz-octA9N-URt6fr-URt7L2-TPBuCz-uKV8od-2bqHVZY-2b91HjB-URt7Qk-2b91HTn-2b91HF8-vGkQYy-2bqHWaN-Ut3mDU\" title=\"California National Historic Trail, Nevada\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"California National Historic Trail, Nevada\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/4337/36742285895_e1ff5a63e5.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n\n<h2>Information</h2>\n\n<p>High Rock Canyon east to High Rock Lake is very rugged and remote and can be driven in four-wheel vehicles by experienced and well equipped explorers.

The headwaters of Little Wildhorse Creek are designated as a Research Natural Area (RNA)/Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) because of a mid-to high-elevation lake and associated ecosystem. This RNA/ACEC was designated to protect the area for scientific study opportunities. Wildhorse and Little Wildhorse Creeks, above their confluence, contain interesting and unique assemblages of vegetative communities.\n\n\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\n<ul><li> \nLimited water sources – carry enough water and food to last your entire trip, and do not drink from untested water sources.\n</li><li> \nTicks, mosquitoes, and rattlesnakes in certain areas during spring and summer.\n</li><li>\nWeather conditions – the mountain’s high elevation can cause rapid temperature changes. Blustery, 100-degree days are common and snow can fall year-round. Be prepared for sudden lightning storms, snow, rain, and high winds.\n</li><li> \nLong distances between services – including gas stations, phones, and cell phone reception. Let someone at home know where you plan to go and when you plan to return. Phone service should not be relied on for emergency communication. Always start your trip with a full tank of fuel and call ahead for current information about fuel availability in the Steens Mountain area. Fuel may be available in the towns of Fields, Frenchglen, Crane, or the Narrows.\n</li><li>\n\nRough terrain – deep canyons and rocky slopes are a natural party of the rugged mountain territory. Elevation can change from less than 4,000 feet to over 9,000 feet in just a few miles. We recommend high clearance or 4x4 vehicles for primitive roads, including the steep and rocky portion of the Steens Mountain Loop Road near South Steens Campground. The rest of the Steens Mountain Loop Road can accommodate passenger cars at lower speeds. High quality tires are a must for all vehicles, even when traveling on maintained routes.\n</li><li>\n\nLivestock and wildlife on roadways – much of southeast Oregon is open range. Be alert, drive with caution, and plan to share roadways with cattle, deer, elk, antelope, wild horses, and rabbits!\n</li><li>\nStaying Found – the remote nature and vast landscape of the Steens Mountain area may leave even the most experienced traveler directionally confused or just plain lost. Traveling with a current map of the area is essential! Don’t hesitate to talk to locals - area landowners and Federal employees are generally visible in the Steens Mountain area. We welcome your visit and have information to help you.\n</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>\n\nWildhorse and Little Wildhorse Creeks provide habitat for California bighorn sheep and a variety of wildlife from headwaters to canyon mouths. Species such as pika can be found at upper elevations. Little Wildhorse Creek contains excellent riparian habitat at higher elevations. Wildhorse and Little Wildhorse Lakes provide vernal high elevation pools, talus and cliffs, willows, and adjacent upland vegetation, which together provide a diversity of wildlife habitats.\n",

    "description": "<p>Birch Creek Wild and Scenic River flows from the windswept ridges and alpine tundra of the <a href=\"/node/9064\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steese National Conservation Area</a> into the broad expanse of the Yukon Flats in central Alaska. The river offers one-week float trips notable not only for scenery and remoteness but for convenience -- floaters can access both ends of the Wild River segment from BLM recreation sites along the Steese Highway.</p>\n\n<p>The BLM manages 110 miles of upper Birch Creek as a wild river as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The river continues through state, private and Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge land for a total of 344 miles before emptying into the Yukon River about halfway between Fort Yukon and Beaver.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/node/14405\" rel=\"nofollow\">Birch Creek Wild and Scenic River</a> offers outstanding recreation opportunities for float boat use for those experienced with canoe, kayak, or raft. Float trips usually take about 50 hours of actual water time to travel the 110 river miles between BLM's put-in and take-out waysides, both located on the Steese Highway. A leisurely trip requires 7 to 10 days. The water is predominately Class I, but there are some Class II and Class III areas.</p>\n\n<p>Although visited primarily in summer, Birch Creek Wild and Scenic River offers many winter activities for those wanting a primitive backcountry experience. Snowmobiling along the creek is popular in March and April as the days get longer and temperatures start to rise. For a few days each February, the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race between Fairbanks and Whitehorse makes portions of Birch Creek busy with dog teams and mushers. Dog mushing, trapping, and cross-country skiing are popular winter activities along the frozen river.</p>\n\n<h2>Monitoring River Levels</h2>\n\n<p>A stream gauge near the put-in at the Upper Birch Creek Wayside at Milepost 94 Steese Highway reports water stage, water temperature, air temperature, cumulative precipitation and water turbidity at 15-minute intervals. Current observations are available on the National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Automated Data System (HADS) website (https://hads.ncep.noaa.gov/charts/AK.shtml).</p>\n\n<p>To view the data, from the station list find station <strong>BCTA2 - Birch Creek above Twelvemile Creek</strong>, select a time interval, and press \"Decoded Data\" to view the tables and graphs of observations. For current river stage conditions, look at the River Height (HG) data. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stage of less than 1.0 feet is very low flow, meaning difficult floating, especially for rafts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stage of 2 feet is moderate flow --good float conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stage of 3 to 3.5 feet or above is considered high water; be prepared for fast current, floating logs, flooded campsites, and potentially dangerous conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Hazardous river channel in upper Birch Creek</h2>\n\n<p>In late July 2023, a new, hazardous river channel was discovered at <strong>Latitude N 65.331462, Longitude W -145.745712, </strong>a few miles downriver from the Upper Birch Creek Wayside. At the time of discovery, during the low flow stages of late July, the entire river flowed into a log-jam and debris-choked channel, requiring a ¼ mile portage through the original, dry river channel. Visit <a href=\"/node/410573\" id=\"menurguj\" title=\"/node/410573\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLM.gov</a> to view the map for the new channel.</p>\n\n<p>At higher river stage levels, we don't know what this hazard means for boaters. Boaters should plan to scout the hazard and be prepared to portage gear around the hazard.</p>\n\n<p>New river channels can take years to clear debris and become safe to float through.</p>\n",

Due to topography, access and river character, these river segments are managed as one river corridor. The rivers between Minam and the Oregon-Washington state line are designated National Wild & Scenic Rivers and Oregon State Scenic Waterways and are cooperatively managed by the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, and Oregon Parks & Recreation Department.<br/>\nMany boaters start their trip on the Wallowa River at Minam, Oregon, a tributary of the Grande Ronde river. Trips launched from here typically last 2 to 3 days, although shorter or longer trips are possible with proper planning. Other river access points include Wildcat (or Powwatka) Bridge, Mud Creek, Troy, Boggan’s Oasis, and Shumaker.</p>\n\n<p>Because the rivers are free-flowing, water level and river character can change suddenly and dramatically depending on the time of year, weather, and snowpack. Typical river levels during the primary floating season range between 2,000 and 10,000 cf/s. (cubic feet per second). High, fast water conditions usually occur in the spring and early summer as warmer temperatures and rainfall melt mountain snow. Shallow, slower conditions typically occur by mid-July and remain through the fall and winter months, with less water and more exposed rocks being common. Boaters are strongly advised to obtain up-to-date river conditions and weather information when planning their trip. Visitors wishing to avoid crowds are advised to plan their trip to avoid weekends and holidays between mid-May and early July.<br/>\nVehicle shuttle routes often include rough roads and may require good map reading skills and/or GPS to follow. Some roads may be unmaintained or impassable inquire locally for current conditions. Gasoline, food, and other services are often not available in rural areas. Cell phone service is generally not available in the remote, rugged terrain of the river corridor. Drivers should be well prepared, and carry extra fuel, food, water, and a spare tire. For safety, always tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Free, self-issued river permits are required for all boating on the Wallowa & Grande Ronde rivers in Oregon, and when using BLM lands above the high-water mark in Washington.</li>\n\t<li>Primitive, undeveloped river camping is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and campsite competition can be high during peak boating season. To maximize your feeling of privacy, avoid trips on holidays and busy weekends or take a trip during the off season.</li>\n\t<li>Visitors are required to follow low impact, “Leave No Trace” principles to minimize the traces of their stay and help preserve the natural resources. Mandatory fire pan and portable toilet use, as well as packing out all garbage and treading lightly on vegetation, helps keep the river corridor clean and healthy for present and future generations. Heavily impacted areas can often lead to further restrictions and may need to be temporarily closed until they can recover.</li>\n\t<li>No amenities or improvements exist in much of the river corridor. Natural and human-created hazards exist, including falling trees, rapids, wildlife, bridge abutments, inclement weather, primitive roads, and rugged terrain. Search and rescue assistance in the canyons is very difficult, dangerous, costly, and time-consuming. Plan ahead, use caution, and be prepared.</li>\n\t<li>For a developed camping experience, consider the Oregon State Parks campground at Minam State Recreation Area, two miles north of Minam, Oregon.

Vegetation is diverse desert scrub, semi-desert grasslands, and chaparral with mesquite, palo verde, ocotillo, saguaro, prickly pear, cholla, catclaw acacia, jojoba, scattered agave, yucca and sotol.</p><p>Land ownership in the area is intermingled BLM, State Trust land, and private property, including property owned by the Access Fund. Public use of State Trust land requires a recreational permit from the Arizona State Land Department. The private property beyond the Access Fund trailhead is not open to public use.</p><h2>Safety Tips</h2><ul><li>Respect and be cautious of local wildlife. Bears, mountain lions, coyotes, and venomous creatures such as rattlesnakes and Africanized bees are common in the area.</li><li>Bring plenty of water. Extreme heat conditions are typical during summer months.</li><li>Severe storms with lightning and flash-flooding may occur, usually from mid-June to mid-September. Always stay out of washes and seek shelter if lightning occurs.</li></ul>",

The basaltic ridge rising above the Three Rivers Valley contains over 21,000 petroglyphs, including masks, sunbursts, wildlife, handprints, and geometric designs. The number and concentration of petroglyphs make this one of the largest and most interesting rock art sites in the Southwest. A rugged 0.5-mile trail (Petroglyph Trail) begins at the visitor shelter and links many of the most interesting petroglyphs. Another short trail (Village Trail) begins on the east side of the picnic area and leads to a partially excavated prehistoric village.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Three Rivers Petroglyph Site is one of the few locations in the Southwest set aside solely because of its rock art. It is also one of the few sites giving visitors such direct access to petroglyphs. The number and concentration of petroglyphs here make it one of the largest and most interesting petroglyphs sites in the Southwest. More than 21,000 glyphs of birds, humans, animals, fish, insects and plants, as well as numerous geometric and abstract designs are scattered over 50 acres of New Mexico's northern Chihuahuan Desert. The petroglyphs at Three Rivers, dating back to between about 200-1450 AD, were created by Jornada Mogollon people who used stone tools to remove the dark patina on the exterior of the rock. A small pithouse is nearby and Sierra Blanca towers above to the east. A detailed petroglyph guide is available at the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site.</p>\n",

    "name": "Donner ьnd Blitzen Wild and Scenic River",
    "description": "<h2>Overview:</h2>Nearly rugged 88 miles of waterways comprise the Donner ьnd Blitzen Wild and Scenic River and its tributaries. The mainstem of the river as well as Big and Little Indian Creeks, Fish Creek, the South Fork and the Little Blitzen River were originally designated in 1988. Several more tributaries were added to the river system in 2000, including portions of Mud and Ankle Creeks. Activities include hunting, fishing, camping backpacking, horse use and other outdoor pursuits. Four developed campgrounds at Page Springs, Fish Lake, Jackman Park and South Steens make great launch points for backcountry adventure  in the area’s wild and scenic rivers.\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\n<ul><li> \nCarry enough water and food to last your entire trip, and do not drink from untested water sources.\n</li><li> \nTicks, mosquitoes, and rattlesnakes in certain areas during spring and summer.\n</li><li> \nWeather conditions – the mountain’s high elevation can cause rapid temperature changes. Blustery, 100-degree days are common and snow can fall year-round. Be prepared for sudden lightning storms, snow, rain, and high winds.\n</li><li> \nLong distances between services – including gas stations, phones, and cell phone reception. Let someone at home know where you plan to go and when you plan to return. Phone service should not be relied on for emergency communication. Always start your trip with a full tank of fuel and call ahead for current information about fuel availability in the Steens Mountain area. Fuel may be available in the towns of Fields, Frenchglen, Crane, or the Narrows.\n</li><li> \nRough terrain – deep canyons and rocky slopes are a natural party of the rugged mountain territory. Elevation can change from less than 4,000 feet to over 9,000 feet over the course of a few miles traveled. We recommend high clearance or 4x4 vehicles for primitive roads, including the steep and rocky portion of the Steens Mountain Loop Road near South Steens Campground. The rest of the Steens Mountain Loop Road can accommodate passenger cars at lower speeds. High quality tires are a must for all vehicles, even when traveling on maintained routes.\n</li><li> \nLivestock and wildlife on roadways – much of southeast Oregon is open range. Be alert, drive with caution, and plan to share roadways with cattle, deer, elk, antelope, wild horses, and rabbits!\n</li><li>\nStaying Found – the remote nature and vast landscape of the Steens Mountain area may leave even the most experienced traveler directionally confused or just plain lost. Traveling with a current map of the area is essential! Don’t hesitate to talk to locals - area landowners and Federal employees are generally visible in the Steens Mountain area. We welcome your visit and have information to help you.\n</li><li>\nWhen recreating on public lands, practice Leave-No-Trace Principles.\n\n</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>\nIn 1860, the U.S. Army sent Major Enoch Steen to determine the feasibility of a road from southeastern Oregon to the Willamette Valley. His party named many prominent topographic features, including Steens Mountain. In 1864, during a thunderstorm, Captain George B. Curry and his command were forced to cross a river on the west slope of the Steens. He named the River \"Donner und Blitzen,\" which is German for thunder and lightning.\n",

The Tangle River connects several of the Tangle Lakes and then drains into the Delta River, which joins the Tanana River, before flowing into the mighty Yukon River.</p>\n\n<p><span>Season and Climate </span></p>\n\n<p>River-running season generally begins in early to mid-June, depending on ice breakup and precipitation. Average annual precipitation measured at Paxson is 11 inches of rain and 120 inches of snow. July is commonly the wettest month. During the summer, temperatures range from 35 °F to 70 °F, with occasional highs in the 80s. By mid-September the shorter daylight and colder temperatures bring the river recreation season to an end.</p>\n\n<p><span>History and Prehistory </span></p>\n\n<p>Native people may have lived in this area as long ago as the end of the last ice age (about 10,000 years ago). Approximately 226,660 acres in the Tangle Lakes area are designated as the Tangle Lakes Archaeological District. This area has hundreds of archaeological sites that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>\n\n<p><span>NOTE: Collection or disturbance of any historic or prehistoric remains is against the law. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Vegetation </span></p>\n\n<p>Vegetation ranges from arctic tundra to spruce-poplar forests. Grasses, sedges and forbs grow on the highest, most exposed slopes and above the brush line. Willows grow on moist lowland sites and in the many brushy draws draining the side slopes.</p>\n\n<p>Dwarf birch occupies drier sites with well-drained soils. Alder grows on steep slopes of hillsides and canyon walls. Forests of white and black spruce grow in small pockets along the river, and on some hillsides below an elevation of 3,200 feet. You will find open spruce-poplar forests on lowland sites along the river and on some mid-slope hillsides.</p>\n\n<p>Understory plants are varied and abundant. Fireweed, bistort, rose, mountain avens, burnet, and shrubby cinquefoil are just some of the many plants in the area. In August, many people travel to Tangle Lakes to pick blueberries. Other harvestable berries in the Delta River area include crowberry, alpine bearberry, cranberry and red currant.</p>\n\n<p><span>Wildlife </span></p>\n\n<p>Wildlife provides opportunities for hunting, trapping, photography and viewing. Hunters seek moose, caribou, bear, Dall sheep, ptarmigan, waterfowl and snowshoe hare. Trappers harvest beaver, fox, wolf, marten, lynx, wolverine, otter, muskrat and mink.</p>\n\n<p>Of the 110 species of birds identified in this area, most are summer residents (May to September). Nesting bald eagles can be observed from Tangle Lakes to the lower Delta River during the summers.</p>\n\n<p>Wildlife viewing is best in the early morning.</p>\n\n<p><span>Fish </span></p>\n\n<p>Tangle Lakes and the Delta River contain grayling, round whitefish, lake trout, burbot and longnose suckers. Most fishing is for grayling, but good lake trout fishing is available in late winter and early spring.</p>\n\n<p>Salmon are not found in the Delta River due to the 15-foot-high falls and the heavy silt load entering from Eureka Creek.</p>\n\n<p>You can purchase an Alaska fishing license and view sport fishing regulations online at the <a href=\"http://www.adfg.state.ak.us\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Alaska Department of Fish and Game </a> website or buy in person from license agents throughout the state, including stores in Glennallen, Delta Junction and Tok.</p>\n",

On a clear day, scenic vistas extend to the horizon.\n\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\n<ul><li> \nLimited water sources – carry enough water and food to last your entire trip, and do not drink from untested water sources.\n</li><li> \nTicks, mosquitoes, and rattlesnakes in certain areas during spring and summer.\n</li><li>\nWeather conditions – the mountain’s high elevation can cause rapid temperature changes. Blustery, 100-degree days are common and snow can fall year-round. Be prepared for sudden lightning storms, snow, rain, and high winds.\n</li><li> \nLong distances between services – including gas stations, phones, and cell phone reception. Let someone at home know where you plan to go and when you plan to return. Phone service should not be relied on for emergency communication. Always start your trip with a full tank of fuel and call ahead for current information about fuel availability in the Steens Mountain area.

Elevation can change from less than 4,000 feet to over 9,000 feet in just a few miles. We recommend high clearance or 4x4 vehicles for primitive roads, including the steep and rocky portion of the Steens Mountain Loop Road near South Steens Campground. The rest of the Steens Mountain Loop Road can accommodate passenger cars at lower speeds. High quality tires are a must for all vehicles, even when traveling on maintained routes.\n</li><li>\n\nLivestock and wildlife on roadways – much of southeast Oregon is open range.

Today, we can embrace the romance of the Old West as we travel this same route. Let the Black Hills Back Country Byway take you on a journey back in time to learn the lessons of these people and the riches from the earth they loved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany primitive side roads provide opportunities for off-highway vehicle driving, and a challenging ride for the experienced mountain bicycler. Rock collectors can visit the nearby <b><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/search-details/274360/1\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Black Hills Rockhound Area</a></b>, while interesting rock formations along the road can be studied and photographed. Hiking along side roads, trails, or cross-country can be rewarded with scenic vistas of the Gila Box or close-up views of the area's plentiful wildlife. Camping and picnicking are permitted on public lands along the road, with several developed sites available. Midway on the byway, the <b><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/canyon-overlook-picnic-area\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canyon Overlook Picnic Area</a></b> provides shaded ramadas with a scenic vista of the Gila River canyon. Closer to the east end of the byway is the <b><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/owl-creek-campground\" rel=\"nofollow\">Owl Creek Campground</a></b> with seven units perched on a cliff overlooking the historic Old Safford Bridge. The south end of the bridge is a popular launch site for those floating the Gila River and for fishing for catfish. The north end of the bridge has a small picnic area. Mule deer, javelina, and quail can be hunted on public lands along the byway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Black Hills Back Country Byway is unpaved, but is accessible to high clearance vehicles during dry weather. Portions of the byway have narrow drop-offs or are confined by steep cliffs. Do not attempt the byway if you have a travel trailer or any vehicle more than 20 feet long. Motor homes and trailers can be left at parking areas provided near kiosks at each end. Please take extra care to drive defensively on this route. Always expect a vehicle around the next bend and remember: mountain courtesy gives uphill traffic the right of way. If you choose to be more adventurous and travel some of the side routes, remember all of these single lane roads require a four-wheel-drive vehicle. These roads are not maintained and portions can be steep, rough, and rocky. Washes crossing these routes tend to make it difficult to tell where the road is at all times.</p>\n",

The monument encompasses two mesas and the canyon of the Agua Fria River. Elevations range from 2,150 feet above sea level along the Agua Fria Canyon to about 4,600 feet in the northern hills. The diversity of vegetative communities, topographic features, and a dormant volcano decorates the landscape with a big rocky, basaltic plateau. This expansive mosaic of semi-desert area one of the most significant systems of prehistoric sites in the American Southwest.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the rich record of human history, the monument contains outstanding biological resources. The area is the home to coyotes, bobcats, antelope, mule deer, javelina, a variety of small mammals and songbirds. Eagles and other raptors may also be seen. Native fish exist in the Agua Fria River and its tributaries.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting Around</h2>\n\n<p>From the Badger Springs exit there is a maintained dirt road leading to the Badger Springs Trailhead. The Bloody Basin Road has a graded surface for the first five miles. Beyond that, a high-clearance vehicle is needed to travel the remainder of the road. Road conditions may change with the weather.

There are no developed trails. The terrain is very rough and rocky with steep cliffs, canyons and remote areas. Be prepared with plenty of water, supplies, and proper hiking equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Badger Springs Trail by exiting Interstate 17 at the Badger Springs exit 256. Follow the gravel road for about a mile to the trailhead parking area. Badger Springs Trail follows an informal trail, the Badger Springs Wash, to the Agua Fria River.</p>\n\n<h3>Camping</h3>\n\n<p>There are no campgrounds in the monument. Dispersed/primitive camping is allowed on the monument. You may pick your own campsite, but please use existing hardened sites and protect riparian areas by camping at least 200 feet from water sources. <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping\" rel=\"nofollow\">Learn more about camping on public lands.</a> Be prepared and bring your own water for all your drinking and camping needs.</p>\n\n<h3>Archaeological Site Viewing</h3>\n\n<p>There are hundreds of archaeological sites in the Agua Fria. We recommend exploring Pueblo la Plata as well as a site at the confluence of Badger Springs Wash and the Agua Fria River. Explore these sites but leave artifacts as they are. <strong>Please help protect these prehistoric and historic sites as an important part of the nation’s heritage.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Safety</h2>\n\n<p>If you're visiting in summer, you should drink plenty of water because temperatures may exceed 110º F (43º C). We recommend wearing sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat. Make sure your gas tank is full, carry additional water in your vehicle, and make sure your vehicle is in good condition. The hot desert sun stirs up rattlesnakes and other reptiles as early as February.</p>\n\n<p>Flash floods caused by sudden storms can be dangerous in washes.</p>\n\n<p>There are no first aid facilities on site. The nearest medical facilities are in north Phoenix.</p>\n",

The water level fluctuates seasonally and has a Surface Area of 310 acres. The reservoirsits at 6,995 ft. and has a max depth of 20 ft. Fishing at Koosharem can be a year round activity. Past surveys found that cutthroat and rainbow trout are showing better growth and condition than in past years. Tackle should imitate chubs: rapalas, lures, large streamers. Cut bait or frozen minnows are also worth a try. This reservoir not only has good fishing, but also offers access to the Paiute ATV trail. OHVers can explore almost 3000 miles of famous scenic trail that traverse mountain tops and rugged canyons. Facilities at the reservoir are limited to day use only, but there are ADA accessible toilets, picnic tables, and a picnic grill available.",

    "name": "Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Located in northwest Nevada is the vast Black Rock Desert - High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area (NCA) managed by the Black Rock Field Office. Congress established the NCA in 2000 to conserve, protect, and enhance resources associated with the California National Historic Trail and surrounding areas including the 10 designated wilderness areas. Not only does the NCA contain fascinating cultural, archaeological, and paleontological traces of the past, but it also offers a rugged brand of recreation activities for today's adventurers. What these million-plus acres lack in developed amenities, they offer in unique and challenging backcountry and wilderness opportunities. The longest intact segments (totaling 175 miles) of the historic Emigrant Trails to California and Oregon is located within the NCA.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Geology</h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>The NCA's geologic features tell a tale of astounding natural forces. The Black Rock Desert playa—a flat expanse of about 200 square miles—once formed the bed of Lake Lahontan, an ancient lake that covered much of northwestern Nevada 15,000 years ago. Today the playa is favored by off-roaders, land sailers, and amateur rocketry groups, and it provides a dramatic venue for large, outdoor events. The area's namesake, a distinctive formation of black rock, is an impressive outcropping of volcanic rocks and limestone.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>American Indians inhabited Black Rock - High Rock country for at least 10,000 years before Euro-American emigrants passed through on their way to California and Oregon in the 19th century. Black Rock Point was a welcome landmark for these settlers. In 1843—44 the famous explorer John C. Frémont traversed what is now the Applegate Trail, pioneering a throughway from which many wagon routes would form. Visitors today can walk along the Applegate and Nobles trails and read signs depicting diary entries from the early emigrants.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Recreational Opportunities</h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Variety of recreational opportunities are present within the NCA suitable for visitors of all experience levels, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Off-Roading and Land-Sailing on the Black Rock Desert Playa.</li>\n\t<li>Historic and wildlife sightseeing along the Emigrant Trail.</li>\n\t<li>Camping dispersedly or at Soldier Meadows Campground.</li>\n\t<li>Camping and star-gazing at one of the cowboy cabins at Steven's Camp, Massacre Ranch, or Soldier Meadows.</li>\n\t<li>Commercial, competitive, and organized events and activities occur in the NCA through the Special Recreation Permit (SRP) Program. For more information on SRPs, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/permits-and-passes/special-recreation-permits/nevada\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nevada SRP Page.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Information</h2>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Please remember this area is rugged and remote, and visitors need to be prepared for backcountry travel with no cell phone signal and few, if any, other people nearby. Black Rock country is a land of extremes—the weather can be hot and sunny one day and cold and snowy the next. Visitors should be prepared for changing weather conditions and carry additional water, food, and clothing.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>High-clearance vehicles with off-road tires (at least 6-ply) are recommended, as is a second spare tire for visitors who plan to travel the dirt roads in and around the NCA. Motorized use is limited to designated routes only, except for the unvegetated, flat surface of the Black Rock Desert Playa.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Contact the Black Rock Field Office for current road and Playa conditions.

Around 1910, miners used the West Fork and the Middle Fork routes to reach the Denali Mining District, about 80 air-miles to the west. <span> NOTE: Collection or disturbance of any historic or prehistoric remains is against the law. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Vegetation and Wildlife </span></p>\n\n<p>Spruce-hardwood forest is the major vegetation type along the Gulkana River. You may see white and black spruce, birch, aspen and popular forests. The understory includes willow, alder, rose, dwarf birch, cranberry, blueberry, Labrador tea, dwarf dogwood, lichens and mosses.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on location, you may see grizzly bear, black bear, moose, caribou, beaver, coyote, otter, bald eagles, kingfishers, and assorted waterfowl. There are more than 33 species of mammals and 59 species of birds known to live in the Gulkana River basin.</p>\n\n<p><span>Fish </span></p>\n\n<p>The Gulkana River's abundant fish makes it one of the most popular sportfishing rivers in Alaska. Its tributaries contain rainbow trout/steelhead, arctic grayling, king salmon (chinook), red salmon (sockeye), whitefish, longnose suckers, and lamprey. The surrounding lakes have good populations of lake trout, burbot and whitefish.</p>\n\n<p>You can purchase an Alaska fishing license and view sportfishing regulations online at the <a href=\"http://www.adfg.state.ak.us\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website or buy in person from license agents throughout the state, including stores in Glennallen, Delta Junction and Tok. Fishing is particularly heavy on weekends in June and July when the kings are running.</p>\n",

Please<a href=\"https://www.recreateresponsibly.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"> RECREATE RESPONSIBLY.</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n\n<p>This national monument covers about 377,000 acres of BLM-administered public land in central Montana. These lands hold a spectacular array of plant life, wildlife, unique geological features, endless recreational opportunities, and significant historical and cultural values. The rugged landscape has retained much of its unspoiled character over the centuries and, as a result, offers outstanding opportunities for solitude and dispersed recreation. In some areas, the BLM lands are intermingled with State of Montana lands and private property. The monument designation applies only to the BLM-managed lands.</p>\n\n<p>The land and the rugged, surrounding uplands (commonly call the Missouri Breaks) are defined in part by their history. The entire region was the homeland and lifeblood of American Indians. The river served as the pathway for Lewis and Clark, then the waterway for steamboats and an attraction for fur trappers and traders. Later, the river and the Missouri Breaks were sanctuaries for desperados trying to stay a step ahead of the law. The land was also a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders.</p>\n\n<h3>Planning Your Visit</h3>\n\n<p>Today, the public lands in the monument make a significant contribution to the local lifestyle and the regional economy. Within the monument, you can float the river, fish, hike, hunt, drive for pleasure, find a little solitude, enjoy a sense of exploration, or simply marvel at the variety of resources around you. If you cannot float the Upper Missouri or visit the backcountry, you'll still be able to experience the cultural and natural history.</p>\n\n<p>Vast portions of the monument are serviced only by graveled and unimproved roads. Much of the monument is not accessible by any road, inviting visitors to explore on foot. Some of the roads are not suitable for low-clearance vehicles, and many roads cross soils that become absolutely impassable when wet. Off-road driving (cross-country travel) is not allowed in the monument.</p>\n\n<h3>Need a Map?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/MT_UpperMissouriRiverBreaks_NM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument (blm.gov)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Helpful Links:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>More Information: <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/upper-missouri-river-breaks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Programs: National Conservation Lands: Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument</a></li>\n\t<li>Visit: <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/learn/interpretive-centers/missouri-breaks-interpretive-center\" rel=\"nofollow\">Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "The Iditarod National Historic Trail celebrates a 2,300 mile system of winter routes that first connected ancient Native Alaskan villages, and later opened Alaska to the last great American gold rush.  The Trail is still in use today with rural residents using it as a overland travel route between communities, muscle-powered competitors and motor-powered competitors using it in long-distance winter races, and modern-day adventurers testing their mettle in some of the most remote areas in North America.  BLM maintains two remote, long-distance segments interspersed with public shelter cabins that provide respite from the elements.  The most practical way to explore the trail is in the winter, when the hundreds of miles of swamps crossed by the Trail are frozen, making for easy passage.  While offering outstanding opportunities for solitude, the Trail demands a high degree of self-reliance by the user, proficiency in extreme winter camping and travel by ski, dog team, snowmobile, or fat tire bike.",

    "name": "Unalakleet Wild and Scenic River",
    "description": "<p>The clear, smooth waters of the Unalakleet Wild and Scenic River (WSR) meander gently among the rolling Nulato Hills and across the broad expanses of the active tundra to the seaside village of Unalakleet, Alaska, at the rocky shores of the Norton Sound. Located 400 miles from Anchorage, the village of Unalakleet has approximately 800 people and is accessible only by plane. The headwaters of the Unalakleet WSR originate in the Nulato Hills. These rolling hills divide rainfall and snow melt between Norton Sound and the Yukon River basin. At this point, the river is swift and channelized; once it reaches the valley floor it begins to meander. For most of its length, the river has a varying pool/riffle nature, which offers a great diversity of river characteristics, boating opportunities, and fishing opportunities. The area’s remote location in Western Alaska means that visitors are unlikely to meet other recreationists while on their journey. However, travelers will likely encounter local fishers and other local travelers in power boats along the lower reaches of the river. Fishing is excellent for Coho, Chum, and Pink salmon. Arctic grayling and Dolly Varden are also plentiful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>KALTAG PORTAGE</strong> The Unalakleet River is located within the Kaltag Portage, which has been an important route for travel, transportation, and trade between Norton Sound and Interior Alaska for thousands of years. It served as a vital link between the Iсupiat and Yup’ik of the coast, and the Yukon River and Athabascan groups in the Interior. During the period of Alaskan development, the Kaltag Portage was used as a route for both the historic Iditarod Trail and the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CLIMATE</strong> The name Unalakleet is an Iсupiaq word meaning “place where the east wind blows.” Summer temperatures average from 40° to 60°F. Rain is common throughout the summer and varies between a light mist and a heavy downpour. Weather conditions can change quickly and summer storms can cause water levels to rise rapidly, creating potential flooding hazards. CAMPING There are no established campsites or public facilities along the river corridor. The Unalakleet WSR corridor ends at its confluence with the Chirosky River, 24 river miles upstream from the village of Unalakleet. In the WSR corridor and below the Chirosky River, there are individual Native allotments which are private. Contact the Unalakleet Native Corporation for permission to camp on Alaska Native lands below the Chirosky River. </p>\n",

The campground also serves as one of the trailheads to the Iron Hills Trail System.</p>\n\n<p>The site is located 3.4 miles outside of the south end of town. Temperatures typically remain cool in the spring and late fall with low's during these times approaching or below freezing. Summer temperatures can often bring the high's into the range of 90-95 degrees Fahrnheit.</p>\n\n<p>The Iron Hills Trail System began as just a 5 mile loop and has since emerged into almost 30 miles of high quality mountain bike trails.

    "name": "Marion Creek Campground",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Marion Creek Campground is nestled on the south side of the Brooks Range in the Middle Fork Koyukuk River valley. It offers vistas of the Brooks Range and has access to the nearby undeveloped trail up to Marion Creek falls. The campground is a perfect basecamp for exploring Alaska’s Brooks Range. There are 27 sites, three of which are accessible. The site is located five miles north of Coldfoot.</p>\n<p>This location is available on a first-come, first-serve basis only. Visitors are required to physically arrive at the campground to claim and purchase a site. Once on-site, you can pay for your campsites(s) by scanning a QR code using the Recreation.gov mobile app. Download the free Recreation.gov mobile app on Android or iOS prior to your arrival as this is a remote area that has limited or no cellular service. More reliable cellular service can be found 5 miles south in Coldfoot.</p>\n\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>The Brooks Range offers excellent recreation opportunities. Explore undesignated routes from the Dalton Highway. Hiking is plentiful up and into the mountains where ridges and drainages provide firm footing, and the forest thins to low-growing tundra. Hiking east from the highway will lead you to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while hiking west of the highway will take you towards Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Choose your route with care, let someone know where you plan on going, carry bear deterrent, and bring topographic maps, a GPS, and a compass with you.</p>\n<p>Panning for gold is allowed on a few federal stream segments along the Dalton Highway south of Atigun Pass (Milepost 244). No panning is permitted in the pipeline right-of-way (27 feet/8.2 m on either side of the pipeline) and no panning on federal mining claims without permission. Suction dredging is prohibited in the Utility Corridor. Visit the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center in Coldfoot to get more information on where you may legally pan for gold. </p>\n<p>There are several excellent river trips along the Dalton:</p>\n<p>•\tThe Jim River and Middle Fork of the Koyukuk River: Class I-II, several access points along the highway.</p>\n<p>•\tAtigun and Sagavanirktok (the Sag) Rivers: Class III-IV+ whitewater, access Atigun at Milepost 271; Sag at MP 306. For expert boaters only.</p>\n<p>•\tIvishak Wild and Scenic River: Class II, access by chartered air service from Deadhorse or Coldfoot.</p>\n<p>Other recreational activities include, bird watching, wildflower spotting/identifying, fishing, bicycling and hunting. </p>\n<p>More detailed information  on all these activities is available at the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center.</p>\n<p>State statute prohibits off-road vehicle use within 5 miles either side of from the highway from the Yukon River to the Arctic Ocean.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The roads, tenting areas, and parking aprons have a gravel surface. There are 27 sites, one of which is designated accessible. Fourteen sites are pull-through, allowing easy access for RVs. The campground has potable water, vault toilets, and trash receptacles. Each campsite has a fire ring and picnic table. There is no electricity and no dump station. A camp host is onsite, and firewood is available.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>The campsites are situated in a spruce forest with wide views of the Brooks Range. Namesake Marion Creek is only a short walk from the campsites. The area provides habitat for squirrels, voles, marten, lynx, wolf, moose, and grizzly and black bears. A variety of birds migrate north to breed in the area and further north. Some of the year-round resident birds include ravens, grouse, chickadees, hawk owls and Canada jays.</p>\n<p>Campers can experience 24-hour daylight during a period of about 30 days around June 21, and abundant light the rest of the summer season.  In late August and into September bright, fall colors in trees and tundra extend for hundreds of miles. Late August and into September, sky gets dark enough that you have chances to see the aurora borealis.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>The original gold rush town of Coldfoot was located on the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk River near the mouth of Slate Creek. It got is name in 1900 when early prospectors reportedly got “cold feet” and left before winter set in.</p>\n<p>Today it is small community serving truckers who drive the “haul road” to Prudhoe Bay, as well as visitors. There is a cafe, lodging, a post office, diesel and gasoline fuel, and limited repair service. Coldfoot is a transition point for people accessing the backcountry via small aircraft.  </p>\n<p>The Arctic Interagency Visitor Center in Coldfoot introduces visitors from around the world to the unique and extreme environment of the Arctic. Explore interpretive exhibits, walk the nearby nature trails, and talk with knowledgeable staff to learn more about the region’s history, natural environment, and recreation opportunities. The visitor center is a partnership between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service (NPS), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The Visitor Center is currently open daily from 11:00 a.m. until 9 p.m. from late May to mid-September, with nightly programs at 8:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>The historic mining village of Wiseman is a few miles to the north. Just after crossing the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk Bridge #1, take the turnoff to the west and follow the signs three miles (5km) to Wiseman. Established in 1907 when miners discovered gold in nearby Nolan Creek, the town was once a bustling community. Many residents today continue to subsist by hunting, trapping, and gardening. They enjoy sharing their stories with visitors. Note that all buildings in the Wiseman area are private property unless noted. Please stay on the roads. </p>\n<p>Travel further north, over Atigun Pass, onto the north slope and coastal plain to experience the dramatic difference from the boreal forest of the Marion Creek Campground area. Landscape is more open, affording chances to see mammals such as Dall’s sheep, muskoxen, caribou, Arctic fox, and Arctic ground squirrels.  Also look for birds such wagtails, wheatears, golden eagles, jaegers, longspurs, shore birds, in breeding plumage.   </p>\n\n<h2>Contact Info</h2>\nThis location has limited staffing.

    "name": "Painted Rock Petroglyph Campground",
    "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Painted Rock Petroglyph Site, approximately 90 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona, provides visitors the opportunity to view an archaeological site containing hundreds of figures and designs carved into rocks, known as petroglyphs. These were produced centuries ago by indigenous peoples. This site is considered important and even sacred to many of the Native American tribes in southern Arizona. Please keep this in mind when you visit and be respectful. Climbing on the rocks is prohibited and we ask that you keep dogs out of the area.There are also inscriptions made by people who passed through during historic times. </p>\n<p>Many important trails are near the site, some of which have been traveled for thousands of years. The 1775 expedition of Juan Bautista de Anza passed nearby on his way to deliver soldiers, padres, settlers, and their livestock to a new home in northern California to secure the area for Spain. In 1846, the Mormon Battalion passed through, following Philip St. George Cooke along some segments of this trail to help secure California from Mexico. This venture included road building tasks along the trail, assuring that future trips could accommodate wagons. A need to improve communication and travel from east to west prompted Congress to fund a stage line. The result was the Butterfield Overland Stage Route, which began service in 1858 and traveled by this site. This mail and freight service guaranteed that the mail, freight, or passengers would be able to travel from Saint Louis to San Francisco in 25 days. Use was halted when the railroad was constructed in 1879.</p>\n<p>Formerly a unit of the Arizona State Park system, jurisdiction of Painted Rock Petroglyph Site returned to the Bureau of Land Management in 1989.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>The day-use site is right next door to the campground and offers two shaded picnic areas and a small interpretive trail around the petroglyph site with informational displays. The petroglyphs face the east-southeast primarily and would have been noticed by any travelers approaching from that direction. Hiking, birdwatching, and star gazing opportunities all present themselves at this site. </p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers visitors 59 individual campsites and two large group sites featuring picnic tables and steel fire rings. There is no water or electric hookups at the campground, but there are two vault toilets and trash collection. The neighboring day-use site has two shaded picnic areas with tables and charcoal grills.</p>\n<p>The path to the Painted Rock Petroglyph Campground is on 11 miles of paved roads with an additional 1/2 mile of a dirt road. All roads in the campground and day-use site consist of hardened dirt and gravel suitable for larger RVs (Class A) and trailers (fifth wheels) when road conditions are dry. This area is prone to flash flooding during monsoon season, so be sure to check the weather before planning your visit.</p>\n\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>Set between impressive geologic features such as Oatman Mountain, a few miles to the northwest  and the Painted Rock Mountains, situated on the eastern horizon, this campground offers scenic panoramic views and plenty of opportunities for solitude and vast night skies. The surrounding area features a diverse Sonoran Desert plant community including the iconic saguaro cactus, various cholla species, barrel cactus, creosote bush, and both ironwood and palo verde trees. The area is home to a large population of desert mule deer and many other desert species such as kit fox, Gambel’s quail, chuckwalla, and desert iguana.</p>\n\n<h2>Contact Info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (602) 867-5400.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p><strong>Woolsey Peak Wilderness</strong></p>\n<p>Woolsey Peak Wilderness offers rugged topography, colorful scenic vistas, rich variety of wildlife and vegetation, and outstanding opportunities for solitude and unconfined recreation. Woolsey Peak stands 3,270 feet above sea level and about 2,500 feet above the Gila River (to the south). The Painted Rock Dam flood- control dam is situated on the Gila River not far from the southwestern corner of the area. Encompassing a major portion of the Gila Bend Mountains, it is barely separated from the smaller Signal Mountain Wilderness to the north. </p>\n<p><strong>Signal Mountain Wilderness</strong></p>\n<p>A narrow, four-wheel-drive road is all that separates Signal Mountain Wilderness from Woolsey Peak Wilderness to the south. Signal Mountain itself, rising just north of the center of the area, reaches a summit of 2,182 feet (1,200 feet above the surrounding desert floor). </p>\n",

Since then, anglers have held high expectations for Pelican Lake. Unfortunately, in 2008 and 2009, adult carp entered Pelican Lake in large numbers and turned the lake from a clear waterbody dominated by largemouth bass and bluegill to a lake dominated by carp. The carp’s ability to outcompete bluegill for food eventually led to a decline in bluegill condition and a few years later, a decline in largemouth bass condition. </p>\n\n<p>The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), and avid Pelican Lake anglers anticipated this decline and convened a working group that developed a management plan for the lakes future success. </p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ouray\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ouray National Wildlife Refuge</a> </p>\n<p>Ouray National Wildlife Refuge lies along the Green River in the Uinta Basin of northeastern Utah.

Zapata Falls and the 628 acres surrounding them are State Trust Lands owned by the Colorado State Land Board and are also a designated Colorado Natural Area. They are cooperatively managed with the Bureau of Land Management.</p>\n\n<p>History</p>\n<p>The name “Zapata” is the Spanish word for shoe and is tied to the history of settlement in the San Luis Valley. In 1864, Mexican families established the community of Zapata at the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and raised sheep and other livestock. In the 1870s, cattleman consolidated land holdings and established one of the San Luis Valley’s first and largest cattle ranches know as Zapata Ranch, which remains an active ranch today. </p>\n\n<p>Geology</p>\n<p>Zapata Falls SRMA perches on the edge of an active rift valley.  The San Luis Valley was formed when geologic activity along the Rio Grande Rift, a giant crack in the earth’s top layers, caused the rugged Sangre de Cristo Mountains to rise and the flat plain of the San Luis Valley to sink.  Bedrock lies 5,000 to 13,000 feet below the valley floor, beneath layers of gravel, soil, and water.</p>\n<p>Approximately two million years ago, alpine glaciers inched down the steep slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Water flowing from the glacier and snowfields in the valley above found a weak spot near the end of a moraine – a huge rock pile deposited thousands of years ago by a glacier. For thousands of years, water has carved its path, forming Zapata Falls.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t Take the Plunge at Zapata Falls</p>\n<p>The cold waters of South Zapata Creek drop more than 25 feet through a narrow, rocky canyon.  Please use extreme caution when hiking or wading around the base of Zapata Falls. In spring and summer, the water is cold, the current may be strong, and the rocks are slippery. In winter, climbing to the base of the falls is a slick proposition. Zapata Creek freezes into a sheet of ice blanketed by snow. Beware, the ice may not be thick enough to support your weight. There is no view of the falls from above; trying to climb the rocky walls is dangerous to you and to people below you. The falls are home to the black swift, a rare and elusive bird that nests only in the misty reaches of waterfalls. Stay on the trails to keep from disturbing the birds nesting in the cliffs. </p>\n\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Zapata Falls Trail </p>\n<p>To reach Zapata Falls, you will need to take a short but arduous hike to Zapata Creek. The falls are upstream from where the trail meets the creek. The only way to view the falls is to get your feet wet by wading carefully upstream to the base of the falls.</p>\n<p>Length: 1/2 mile each way</p>\n<p>Elevation: 9,000 to 9,400 feet</p>\n<p>Connections: South Zapata Lake Trail (U.S. Forest Service Trail #852)  </p>\n\n<p>Other Nearby Attractions:</p>\n<p>•\tNPS-Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve.  </p>\n<p>•\tUSFS-Rio Grande National Forest and Sangre de Cristo Wilderness.</p>\n<p>•\tBLM-Blanca Wetlands Recreation Area.</p>\n<p>•\tUSFWS-Baca and Alamosa National Wildlife Refuges.</p>\n<p>•\tGreat Sand Dunes Oasis-Restaurant, gift shop, and lodge (near GRSA Park entrance).</p>\n<p>•\tFt.
