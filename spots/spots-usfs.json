There are tables, fire-rings, and vault toilets. Bring your own water or purify the creek water nearby. 3 day limit, per person, per year. No fee. No reservations. Self-register on site. Usually opens around July 1st, depending on winter snowpack, and closes November 1st. Features: Highest campground on the mountain with open views and vistas. There are two small sub-alpine heather meadows a short distance from the campground. Because of the fragile nature of the meadows, great care must be given by all who visit not to incur damage. In recent years, a major effort has been made by local tribes, volunteers, and the Forest Service to re-vegetate the native species and improve the trail system to minimize erosion.",

A number of picnic tables and tent pads were placed within the visible outlines of old cabin foundations.\nMany relics of Reef's mining history, including the remains of the town's old water system and miscellaneous features, are still visible in and around the campground.

    "description": "Clark Creek Organization Camp, located 12 miles northeast of Lowell, Oregon, is a historic group campground constructed during the 1930s by the efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps in coordination with the U.S. Forest Service. Organization camps were created for the purpose of hosting group recreational activities on public lands. Historically, groups that routinely used organization camps were the Boy Scouts of America and local church groups. The camp features five bunkhouses each with eight platform sleeping bunks, plus a large field to pitch tents, play baseball, volleyball or throw a frisbee. There is also an amphitheater and a large cooking/dining shelter. The day-use area and sleeping shelters are separated by Clark Creek. Access is over a foot bridge. The site accommodates up to 80 overnight guests but up to 125 guests can make use of the group area during the day time. Clark Creek is extremely popular for group events and functions, so plan ahead when making reservations. Several hiking and biking trails, swimming areas, and open fields offer fun opportunities for large groups with varied interests. Fall Creek is located across Forest Road 18, and Clark Creek runs adjacent to the sleeping area.",

Primitive Camping:Camping is primitive, with no facilities such as tables, toilets or drinking water. Wildlife:The diversity of habitats along the road attracts a variety of wildlife, so stop frequently to scan the surrounding area. During the breeding season in spring, watch for nesting bald eagles and listen for loons calling from the water. Walk along the edge of the bay in the spring and fall and scan the adjacent trees and shrubs for migrating songbirds. In the summer, stop for a swim and watch for waterfowl feeding in the shallow bay. This is also an important winter deer range as the browse line on the trees indicates. Small Boats Allowed:Trails traverse the area and provide a wonderful experience.  Depending on water levels, the boat launch may be used to launch small boats.  Kayak and canoe access is available.

    "name": "GORDON HIRABAYASHI CAMPGROUND",
    "description": "This site is also known as Prison Camp. The site was a Federal Honor Camp beginning in 1937 to house federal prisoners supplying labor to build a road for access into the Santa Catalina Mountains. Prisoners had been convicted of federal crimes ranging from immigration law violations to tax evasion to bank robbery.\nDuring World War II, many of the prisoners of this camp were conscientious objectors whose religions prohibited them from serving in the military. Some were Japanese Americans protesting the Japanese American Relocation, the largest forced removal and incarceration in U.S. History that started after the Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. Over 100,000 Japanese Americans, many American Citizens, were imprisoned in internment camps for fear they would conduct espionage and sabotage along the west coast.\nGordon Hirabayashi was a senior at the University of Washington in 1942. He challenged the constitutionality of internment based on race or ancestry. He turned himself in to the FBI rather than report for relocation. He was convicted and sentenced to serve at the Federal Honor Camp in the Santa Catalina Mountains.\nIn 1987, Hirabayashi's case was overturned. A federal commission determined that the internment had been motivated by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria. In 1988, the Civil Liberties Act was signed by President Ronald Reagan, which acknowledged the injustice and apologized for the internment. In 1999, the Coronado National Forest renamed the site in honor of Dr. Hirabayashi and the other resisters of conscience who were imprisoned there. Dr. Hirabayashi and others attended the dedication ceremony. NOTE: RV Camping is 22 feet and less. No hookups. No pack and saddle stock permitted in campground.  Pack and saddle stock are allowed in group site. The Sheep Management Area in nearby Pusch Ridge Wilderness is closed to dogs for the protection of desert bighorn sheep. Mountain bike access is generally east of the campground and not allowed in",

No firewood or refuse receptacles are provided. This campground is considered to be remote and is normally not heavily used, yet it is very attractive with  the free flowing creek, and open grassland nearby. This area looks very different now due to the removal of dead and dying trees, a result of the spruce beetle. The road into the campground is too narrow and rough for large trailers and RVs. The campground is really more suitable for tents and popup camping trailers, as there are no long developed spurs or pull-throughs. Scroll Down to Information Center to see the individual campsite descriptions. This is also the site of the Ivy Creek Trailhead and Bulletin Board. All Parking for the trailhead users is outside the fenced in campground where there is a hitching rail and room for horse trailers. Ivy Creek Trail #805 goes into the Wilderness and provides the quickest route to Goose Lake. This is a trail open to foot and horse travel only.

The Mogollon Rim, pronounced by locals as \"\"muggy-own,\"\" is a 200-mile long cliff in northern Arizona that ranges between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation. The unique landscape was created by extreme erosion and faulting that has sculpted spectacular canyons and buttes. The rim serves as the geographical dividing line between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below. The operating season is April-October.\nSharp Creek Group Campground is popular for large groups. Weddings, birthday parties, anniversaries and more may be hosted at the group sites. Each group site has a designated vault bathroom with paved parking lot for friends and families to visit for the day. A large open field is shared in the middle of the group sites to hold mini games for families.\nRecreation: The campground is in a central location for hiking, fishing, boating and picnicking. Anglers can try for trout in nearby Christopher Creek. Hikers can access the historic Highline National Recreational Trail, which runs for 51 miles along the base of the Mogollon Rim, from the 260 Trail three miles east of the campground. Two lakes nearby offer additional fishing and boating options.\nFacilities: Sharp Creek is a small campground with 28 campsites conveniently spread out into three loops. Campsites are spacious, comfortable and well-maintained, with some shade. Each has a picnic table, grill, campfire ring and lantern holder. An additional loop contains three group campsites that can each accommodate 75 people. A group picnic shelter is available as well.",

The site is not developed, but dispersed camping opportunities are limited. This location is also stop #6 on the Glade Top Trail Scenic Byways tour. The 1930s plat book shows J.W. Findley as the owner of the land now known as Wolf Junction. Other individuals owned the land before Mr. Findley, but he left a lasting impression that is part of Ozarks history. Mr. Findley was a noted author, local historian, and was known as the walking preacher of the Ozarks. In his retirement, J.W. Findley wrote 8 books, each relating to the Missouri Ozarks. He was 92 years old when he died in 1990 while living in Ava, MO. You can tell by the following quote that J.W. Findley was fond of the Ozarks: \"And when Indian Summer comes and God hangs a shimmering curtain of blue purple over these Ozark Hills, and the trees put on their robes of scarlet and gold, just take a drive over the Glade Top (Skyline) drive and you'll say you've seen a little bit of Ozark Glory, too. God must have loved our hills a lot, or He wouldn't have made so many of them.\" (Ozark Glory,1985 J.W. Findley)The White River Historical Society located in Forysyth, MO was very helpful in gathering information for this stop. If you would like to learn more about Taney County history, visit their website http://wrvhs.org/. According to the 1930s plat book, lands now known as Willie Lee were once owned by the Rialto Land and Mining Co. in the 30s. The company owned several acres of land in the immediate area. Research has not found much information regarding this company.",

Accessible flush toilets, drinking water and coin-operated showers are available at Cove Creek. In the day use area, there is about 1,000 ft. of shoreline.

Today, it's listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. If you want a break from recreating, it's convenient to visit the Fort Klamath park and museum. Annie Creek offers more amenities than the average Sno-Park. As an official stop on the Oregon Volcanic Scenic Byway, you'll find an interpretive kiosk, as well as two vaulted toilets. An attractive log-style warming shelter with wood stove and benches is open year round for picnics and relaxation. Snowmobilers can enjoy cruising under snow covered ponderosa pines and accessing miles and miles of trails. There are no managed cross country ski trails from Annie Creek. Besides snowmobiling, winter enthusiasts of all ages flock to Annie Creek Sno-Park for excellent sledding opportunities. Adjacent to the warming shelter lies a huge bowl shaped hill perfect for coasting your sled down. At an elevation of 4,400 feet, Annie Creek generally sees snow from late November through February.

Developed campgrounds with picnic tables, grills and designated fire pits may be reserved for large families to spend quality time together. Campers may pass the time listening to ambient sounds of foliage fluttering in the breeze and the creek flowing in the distance. The operating season is April - October.\nWith an elevation over a mile-high (5640 ft), Christopher Creek Campground's crisp, fresh air and vibrant views are a joy to behold. The facility is tucked along the banks of the spring-fed Christopher Creek, which passes just below the Mogollon Rim.\nThe Mogollon Rim, pronounced by locals as \"\"muggy-own,\"\" is a 200-mile-long cliff in northern Arizona that ranges between 5,000 and 7,000 ft in elevation. The rim serves as the geographical dividing line between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below. Christopher Creek is in the desert portion, but is balanced by the cool waters of the creek and forested surroundings.\nRecreation: After a day of horseback riding or mountain biking, take a dip to cool off from the summer sun. Each spring, the creek is stocked with rainbow trout, allowing anglers the opportunity to cast their hearts out for rainbows as well as brook and brown trout.\nFacilities: The family-friendly campground has 43 sites on both sides of the creek, plus a group site that accommodates a maximum of 25 people.\nNearby Attractions: The small town of Christopher Creek is just a short drive away and offers a few restaurant options for those who tire of cooking at the campground. A series of lakes called the Rim Country Lakes are about a 10-minute drive east. Woods Canyon Lake is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state and offers options for boating as well as a nature trail that loops around the lake's perimeter.",

The area is known for camping, scenic driving, picnicking, birding, wildlife viewing, hiking, mountain biking, and history. There are no amenities at this site. Refer to our Dispersed Camping page for more information and dispersed camping best practices.\nHospital Flat is so named because in the 1880s it served as a site for a field hospital for ailing soldiers from Fort Grant. That frontier outpost is located along Grant Creek on the south slope of the Pinale?os. The restorative powers of this cool mountain meadow, carpeted with wildflowers and traversed by a small creek, were sufficiently notable that it also became a summer retreat for officers and their families trying to escape the heat of their desert outpost. Fort Grant was closed in 1905 and now serves as an Arizona State Prison Facility. Hospital Flat still serves as a popular refuge for forest recreationists who come to its pleasant surroundings for much the same reason as those soldiers.\nNote: Black bear area. Store and dispose of all food in bear-proof containers and trash bins, or keep it locked in your vehicle. Vehicles (including trailers) longer than 22 feet are not recommended because of the difficulty of negotiating the switchbacks on AZ 366. This dispersed camping area is not accessible by vehicle from November 15 to April 15 when the Swift Trail is closed for the winter. Early or late snow may extend the inaccessible season.",

    "description": "Located adjacent to the Black River, the Markham Springs Recreation Area contains bubbly springs and a small 2-acre pond that dates back to the 1800s. The area is covered by a dense forest of colorful trees, including ash, elm, maple and poplar. Six springs pour almost 5 million gallons of water a day into the pond, from there the water eventually makes it's way to the Black River. The bubble spring, a smaller outlet of Markham Spring outside of the pond area, has air with it, rises in soft sand forming the unique  air bubbles .This area gets its name from former owner, M. J. Markham, who acquired the property in 1901 and operated a lumber mill at the site until the 1930s. The Fuchs House, a five-bedroom concrete and native stone home, also sits on the property, along with a neighboring mill.&nbsp;The historic Fuchs house was restored by a group of craftsmen under permit from the National Forest. In the late 1930's, Rudolph Fuchs built a 5-bedroom concrete and native stone house for his family, and also built the present wheel house to produce electricity for his needs. Power was obtained by building a dam in a semi-circle below a large spring forming a small pond. The water was to pour through a chute on the wheel to produce electricity; however electricity arrived to the site before the wheel ever needed to do its job. The area had an undershot wheel providing power to a grist mill in the late 19th century. River and stream fishing are popular activities near the campground. The Black River boasts bass, sunfish, walleye and catfish. Many anglers fish from boats, but others fish from the riverbanks. Canoeing and kayaking is also possible on the river.&nbsp;Markham Springs Recreation Area provides opportunities for camping, hiking, and day use. Various day hikes within the Markham Springs Trail System are accessible from the campground. Eagle Bluff Trail is a 1.5-mile loop along the river, where birding and wildlife viewing are favorite pastimes.",

Located on the high and lovely Horseshoe Lake. Located just south of Monon Lake in the Olallie Scenic Area, Horseshoe Lake Campground is sandwiched between the shoreline of Horseshoe Lake and NF-4220. Due to the area 's remote nature, although the campsites are just off of NF-4220, few vehicles pass by which makes this outdoor recreation area so special. The lake, as the name might imply, is horseshoe-shaped with a small channel leading to the lake's southern half. Recreational activities include hiking, fishing, and non-motorized boating.",

Larger ponderosas release a vanilla scent into the air and have a relatively open understory, making the area perfect for camping. Mixed into the understory are junipers, oaks and manzanita shrubs. The campground sits on the border of the Mogollon Rim, pronounced by locals as \"\"muggy-own,\"\" a 200-mile-long cliff in northern Arizona that ranges between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation. The unique landscape was created by extreme erosion and faulting that has sculpted spectacular canyons and buttes. The rim serves as the geographical dividing line between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below.\nRecreation: Most visitors enjoy taking advantage of the area's hiking trails and lakes or simply relaxing at the campsite. Scenic driving and outdoor recreation abound in the surrounding Tonto National Forest. A series of lakes called the Rim Country Lakes are about a 15 minute drive east. Woods Canyon Lake is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state and offers options for boating.\nFacilities: The facility provides 47 single campsites and two group sites that can accommodate up to 25 people each.

The site has a colorful history.  Thomasson water mill operated along the Morgan Spring branch until the early 1900's and B.B. Morgan operated an aquaculture business that provided millions of aquarium plants all around the world. All of this beauty could have been at the bottom of a lake if the Army Corps. had not met such fiery opposition from Morgan and others who wanted to preserve the Eleven Point River for posterity. The Eleven Point River was protected by the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, and the Narrows property entered into Forest Service ownership in 1972.

Most of the sites have features that are accessible to individuals with disabilities. The primary purpose of the Sullivan Creek Recreation Site Enhancement project is to enrich recreational opportunities, reduce soil compaction, reduce erosion, decrease sediment flow into Sullivan Creek, enhance fish habitat, improve sanitation, and reduce the potential for animal conflicts with forest visitors. Other projects in Sullivan Creek that are part of the Boundary Dam License include: the Mill Pond Dam removal; recreational improvement projects; installation of large wood jams to improve fish habitat; fish management projects; and road improvement projects, including culvert replacements.",

    "description": "When early settlers ventured up Mount Graham, the Arcadia area was usually as far as they got on the first day. A little later in the history of the Pinalenos, Arcadia was the site of one of several Civilian Conservation Corps camps established in the 1930s to provide jobs for workers idled by the Great Depression. Today, Arcadia Campground, which has 19 campsites, is the first campground visitors encounter on their way up Mount Graham by way of the Swift Trail (AZ 366), which was built by those Depression-era workers. Arcadia Campground is shaded by stands of tall ponderosa pine interspersed with Gambel oaks and Arizona walnuts. Such a diverse habitat makes this an excellent area for bird watching. Watch for poison ivy.\nNote: Black bear area. Store and dispose of all food in bear-proof containers and trash bins, or keep it locked in your vehicle.",

If you want to get away from it all and really enjoy the beauty of southwest Oregon, Sq___ Lakes is the ideal opportunity for that. The air is clean and the water fresh,and at night, the stars are bright!Hiking and fishing top the list of recreational opportunities at Sq___ Lakes Campground. Two mountain lakes, a river and a handful of hiking trails are accessible from the campground. Anglers enjoy the remote location and scenic backdrop of two natural lakes, providing excellent fishing opportunities for coldwater and warmwater species. Sq___ Lake, larger than its sister, sustains rainbow and cutthroat trout, yellow perch, brown bullhead and black bass. Little Sq___ Lake provides a rare fishery for 8-11\" wild, native coastal cutthroat trout. A 0.25-mile hiking trail connects the lakes. Motors are not permitted on the lakes. From the campground, Little Sq___ Trail is a 1-mile interpretive hike that provides visitors with many opportunities for picnicking and swimming. The 2-mile Summit Lake Trail travels through a mixed conifer forest and small water crossings. Paddle boats alone are allowed on the lake, making it a great place to canoe or raft and check out the wildlife.Sq___ Lakes Campground contains 10 individual sites and five group sites. All sites are walk-in and designated for tent camping only. They are reachable by walking on foot trails from the parking area. Vehicles must be parked outside the gated area, and all personal belongings must be carried to the campsite.

Hospital Flat still serves as a popular refuge for forest recreationists who come to its pleasant surroundings for much the same reason as did those soldiers.

The two primary reasons dogs are not allowed in the swimming area are sanitation and safety concerns related to the high numbers of people, including young children, who visit the lake. Sanitation is a concern because no outlet exists for the small lake and water quality becomes an issue, especially later in the season as the water warms. If you want to camp in an area where dogs are allowed, nearby Suttle Lake offers campgrounds and four day use areas where dogs are welcomed. Visitors with dogs are reminded that leashes are required in all developed recreation sites. People may be fined $100 if they bring onto or possess a dog in a swimming area where dogs are prohibited (36 CFR 261.17(k)).",

    "description": "Red Bluff Campground is named for towering red bluffs along Huzzah Creek, carved by the elements over the past 10,000 years. The area used to be home to timber mills, but now provides a serene spot for camping and enjoying nature. Early settlement of the area surrounded the Boyer Mill constructed around 1830. Railroads created a thriving timber industry till the supply was depleted. The land was purchased by the U.S. Forest Service in 1940 and has been used as a recreation area. Large, red bluffs on the opposite side of Huzzah Creek, gravel bars along the creek, a mixture of pools and riffles and natural vegetation provide a backdrop for a very relaxing camping experience at the campground. Red Bluff is located in the Potosi-Fredericktown Ranger District of the Mark Twain National Forest. Most sites are within 100 yards of Huzzah Creek, where tubing and swimming are enjoyed by visitors. The water can be swift-moving at times and rocks and drop-offs are not marked. Fishing is also popular in the area and anglers can expect to find bass, perch and catfish. The Red Bluff Trail lies within the boundaries of the campground. It is a 1.2-mile loop that winds through a pine plantation and big oak timber, into an adjoining hollow before returning to the campground. The short trail provides an opportunity for visitors to enjoy a variety of ecological communities, while reaping the benefits of a half-hour of hiking.",

The campground was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s and includes a welcoming day use shelter with a fireplace and five pull-through RV parking loops and a mix of standard parking spurs. This is a smaller campground with a variety of sites to accommodate different uses, with group sites, sites for trailers and sites for tents. Drinking water is from two hand pump wells. Parking spurs are gravel and roads are paved. Vault toilets and garbage cans are spread out in convenient locations in the campground. Firewood is available for a fee. Plenty of river activities and hiking opportunities await. Enjoy fishing and swimming in the beautiful South Santiam River or hiking the accessible Yukwah Nature Trail   that winds through the campground, and lingering at the picnic area. Hike or bike the Santiam Wagon Road (now a trail), a historic trail used to transport livestock east across the Cascade Mountains to central Oregon 's grasslands. Iron Mountain, Gordon Meadows and Echo Basin are nearby hiking areas well known for their colorful wildflowers.",

Sunbeam Dam was the only dam ever built on the Salmon River, which remains one of the last free-flowing rivers in the west.

Warner Lake is about 30 miles from Moab but it takes about an hour to reach the site from Moab and it is a 1.5 hours drive to Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. There is currently no potable water available at the campground, lake or cabin. Plan on bringing all the water that you will need for your stay. We hope to have the well up and running this summer. Please call the Moab Ranger District for further details.",

Trail #20 runs south, and then east, out of the campground, providing miles of first-class bank fishing opportunities.  The trail eventually junctions with FSR 500, the Lolo Motorway.",

Visitors enjoy swimming, cycling, boating, canoeing, fishing and hiking the various trails near the river. Nearby is the inactive Bigfoot trap, built in 1974 by the North American Wildlife Research Team and found along the Collings Mountain Trail. The trap was inspired by a miner who lived near the Applegate River who claimed to have found 18-inch-long, human-like tracks in his garden. The organization operated the trap, keeping it baited with carcasses for six years, but caught only bears. Currently the Forest Service keeps an eye on the trap, but otherwise does not maintain it. It 's a popular site in the area, as it 's the only known bigfoot trap in the world! The campground has eight tent only campsites, three dry RV sites and one group site. Campsites are located along the Applegate River. Camp trailers are not recommended due to tight corners and short campsite spur lengths. The day use area is adjacent to campground. Drinking water and flush toilets are available, as well as an on-site general store. Kayak and paddle board rentals are available at Applegate, $30 for 3-hrs or $45 all-day. There is also a boat ramp offered. Please note, there is a two-night minimum when you desire to reserve a Friday or Saturday night. Rates are: Standard site: $20/night Non-electric and dry RV Sites: $20/night Group Site: $40/night Reservations are made through www.recreation.gov or by calling 1 (877) 444-6777.",

This scenic campground is located on the south shore of Miller Lake 40 minutes east of Chemult, Oregon.

A dense growth of mixed conifers including hemlock, white pine, white fir and sugar pine, provide ample shade. Osprey, eagles, loons and grebes are local residents. June and July are heavy mosquito months, so bring bug spray. The best part about camping at Digit Point is that it offers a full array of ac¿¿tivities including biking boating, fishing, hiking and swimming. Miller Lake 's brown, rainbow and brook trout and Kokanee salmon pose a challenge for anglers of any age. A person can also fish 24 hours a day here.

This five-mile loop trail also allows hikers to access the Pacific Crest National  Scenic Trail; and Maidu Trail.

    "description": "This small, remote campground and picnic area located at the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp of 1937 provides a quiet setting for escaping from your normal routine. With just 8 individual campsites and a picnic shelter, it is enjoyed by campers, picnickers, mountain bikers, equestrians, and hikers. The Berryman Trail leaves from this recreation area, and traverses 24 miles of scenic Ozark countryside and winding through timbered stands and fields. The hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding offer one a pleasant measure of solitude and quiet. The western section of the trail also serves as part of the Courtois Section of the Ozark Trail. History of the Berryman CCC Camp The Berryman CCC Camp, also known as Lost Creek, was home to the 3733rd Company and was designated Camp Number F-MO-13. The camp's initial construction began on May 29, 1935, under the command of Lieutenant Charles C. Isely. Twelve men were selected from Company 732 at Boss, Missouri to be the first enrollees of the 3733rd Company and were to be in charge of the cooking, road work, and other work that required special training.; The early camp conditions were described by Robert Fechner, author of What the CCC Is and Does: Company 3733, Berryman, MO, as follows: The men lived in one of the uncompleted buildings for two weeks, cooking and eating in the open, and in all enduring hardships that in the light of the present conditions, seem unreal. The initial camp enrollees were tasked with &;lifting the camp out of the mud and brush; (Direct Advertising Company 1937:146). Presumably this colorful language meant that the camp location was cleared of brush, trees, and other vegetation and the landforms leveled so that construction of buildings could begin. By July 5, 1935, George E. Maness, Relief Director for Washington County, directed that a total of 41 men and seven alternates between the ages of 18 and 28 on the county relief rolls were to be sent to the Berryman CCC Camp.",

The campground is  situated above Ruby Lake below the beautiful Ruby Mountains at a 6,000' elevation, near the Ruby Lake tiol Wildlife Refuge in Ruby Valley Nevada. Ruby Valley is a surprising wildlife oasis. An expansive marsh is laced with riparian corridors coursing with cool, spring fed waters. Together with lush meadow and shrub-steppe uplands, these habitats support a diversity of wildlife seldom found in the high desert and is one of the most important waterfowl nesting areas in the region. The refuge is either home or a stopover location for over 220 species of birds. Of specific interest are canvasback ducks, trumpeter swans, greater sandhill cranes and sage grouse. Mule deer and pronghorn antelope can also be found in the area. Ruby Lake is visible from the campground and offers excellent birding, fishing and hiking. The lake is stocked with largemouth bass and several species of trout. The Ruby Lake NWR headquarters is 2 miles north of the campground and offers visitor information. The campground is located on the Hastings Cutoff route, near the Pony Express Trail and historic ruins of Fort Ruby. A new interpretive trail was recently constructed at the Fort Ruby historic site and provides insight on local history as well as spectacular views of the southern Ruby Mountains and beyond, all relatively uninterrupted by human development. The southern trailhead for the Ruby Crest tiol Recreation Trail at Green Mountain is located within a reasoble driving distance from the campground. Many dirt and gravel roads begin at Harrison Pass (just north of the refuge) and Overland Pass (south of the area) and provide enjoyable routes for jeeps, off road motorcycles, OHVs, and mountain bikes. A forest of pinyon pine and juniper covers the area offering partial shade. Vault toilets, and drinking water are provided during the main summer sea",

Bill talked about there being a lot of gold washers coming up the river. They would come up the old mining trail from Waneta where the last bridge is on the river before it goes into the Columbia. That trail came all the way up the Columbia River and around the west bank of the Pend Oreille all the way down to Metaline Falls at the top of the hill, also known as old Blue Ribbon Trail.

This designation indicates that the site possesses exceptional value as an illustration of the nation's natural heritage and contributes to a better understanding of the environment.\nIn an area which was mostly clear-cut in the 1800s, 20 acres of what is now Hearts Content was owned by Wheeler and Dusenbury Lumber Company from 1897 to 1922. Wheeler and Dusenbury deeded the land to the U.S. Forest Service in 1923. Shortly after, Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) workers constructed the campground, picnic area, and a pavilion in 1936.\nThe 12-mile Hickory Creek trail begins just north of the campground, exploring a designated Wilderness area.

The year-round campground is equipped with drinking water, vault toilets, a picnic area, trash bins, and recycling receptacles. Horses are welcome in the 12 corrals provided. Head to Horsfall Campground for the use of token operated showers. Some parts of the dunes are designated for hiking and horseback riding only, while off-road vehicle (OHV) enthusiasts can roam free on the dunes north of the campground. Horse campers come here to explore the Wild Mare Horse Trail #4500, which begins at the Wild Mare Day Use under a canopy of alder and spruce, and then emerges into an open dune area that crosses down to the beach. In the mid-twentieth century, the Nels Peterson family of Coos County, Oregon raised livestock, providing animals for rodeos. They leased property for grazing, including the dunes along ocean beaches. In 1954 they took a group of horses to the dunes. One horse was a year-old filly. A year later, when the Petersons were not able to use that area any longer, they rounded up the horses to transport them to another place. As the animals were being herded into a corral, the filly, then two years old, jumped over the eight-foot fence and ran into the dunes. The Petersons tried many times to catch her, even using relay teams to run her down, but she always escaped. After an announcement that anyone could have the horse if they could catch her, other people tried. But her brown coloring was good camouflage and her splayed hoofs enabled her to run through woods, water, wet sand, and steep-sided dunes. Known as the Wild Mare, she survived without human help and lived wild and free for thirty-two years. A local legend, she has been celebrated in prose, poetry, song, and in the naming of the Siuslaw National For",

Natural Features: The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old growth forest, and rugged shrub-steppe country. The American Forks Campground is nestled in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and a cedar under story with grassy areas, ferns, and mosses. With the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, elk, porcupine, native fish, and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the northern spotted owl, gray wolves, and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems. Summer temperatures are generally sunny and warm with little precipitation, and winters boast mostly clear skies, but plenty of snow. Recreation: The campground setting provides ready access to Bumping Lake, where boating and fishing are popular. Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage. In winter, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing are popular in the American River area. The cabin is also conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of Chinook Pass and Mt. Rainer National Park. A trip along the scenic Mather Parkway is a fantastic outing. The American River, adjacent to the campground, offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout. Whitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the river or one of the many other tributaries draining into the Cascade region. Facilities: The campground has 8 reservable sites and 4 first-come, first-served sites between Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend. There is no water available at the campground",

The recreation area consists of two camping loops, a shower house, a swim beach, group camping sites, and a 2.7 mile loop trail.  The Trail is marked with off-white diamonds, starts and ends at Loleta, from the parking lot near the group camping site through the woods around the upper camping loop and comes back in between the upper loop and the group site.\nThis area has been recently nominated and accepted onto the National Register of Historic Places. The area was once a bustling logging town, established in 1889, with over 600 inhabitants. The town had a large sawmill, shingle mill, broom handle factory and a rail connection for shipping products to Sheffield, PA. Once the timber supply was exhausted in 1913, the mills shut down and the town was deserted.\nThe Federal Government purchased the site in 1925, adding it to the newly formed Allegheny National Forest. In the 1930s, the Forest Service (using CCC labor) reconstructed the mill pond, added a bathhouse, swimming area, picnic shelters, and landscaping. The distinctive quality of CCC workmanship is evident today in the dam stonework and the log construction of the old bathhouse. The camping loops were added in the 1960s.\nNearby, trout fishing is popular in Millstone Creek. About 4 miles south of Loleta, the picturesque Wild and Scenic Clarion River offers excellent fishing and canoeing. About 10 miles North of Loleta, Buzzard Swamp offers 10 miles of trail and wildlife viewing.",

The dock at Williams Landing can be used for loading and unloading, but boats may not be left there. Jet skis/motorboats are prohibited from landing on shore. Murray Bay, Trout Bay and North Beach have sand beaches with little to no obstructions where a kayak or paddle boat can land. Most locations on the northwest and northeast sides are sheer cliffs. There are 21 designated campsites, including 2 group sites. Reservations are required Memorial Day through Columbus Day, except for Cobble Cove, Flat Rock, and Muskrat Point, which are first-come/first-served. All reservations must be made through Recreation.gov and can be made up to, and including, the day of arrival. Campsites provide picnic tables, campfire rings, benches and bear poles or lockers. Drinking water is available at Williams Landing, Juniper Flats, Farrell Cottage and Murray Bay.  If traveling elsewhere on the island, bring water with you or filter/boil/treat surface water. The Bermuda campsite is found near Murray Bay and accommodates up to 6 people, with a maximum of 2 tents.  A day use picnic area, vault toilet and group campsite are nearby at Murray Bay; camping is not allowed in the day use site. With its proximity to the group site and picnic area, Bermuda may not be the most desirable site for solitude and peace and quiet while a group is present, but if you don't mind a more sociable atmosphere, this is a great place to set up camp.  The site is easily accessed 1.5 miles from Williams Landing via trail or leave your kayak on Murray Beach and walk 75 yards to the campsite.",

Its location in the central Columbia River Gorge makes it a a convenient basecamp for the Gorge 's many outdoor adventures and historic sites. Like most Gorge campsites, it is near a railroad and interstate so campers should expect some background noise. No hookups are available, but there is potable water onsite. Only small trailers and RVs, less than  30 feet overall in length fit, so the campsites are best suited for tent camping.From the campsite, visitors can day hike the Gorge Trail #400  from the small Gorton Creek Trailhead to the southwest  of the campground. A recently restored segment of the Historic Columbia River Highway that runs from Wyeth to Viento State Park  passes through  talus slopes, spectacular views, waterfalls, and mossy forests. Campers could also bike about three miles east along Wyeth Bench Road to grab a meal or explore in Cascade Locks. Note that adventurous types could bike to water access at either Viento State Park (the day use area provides water access) or via Blackberry Beach in the Cascade Locks area. The Wyeth area has an interesting  history, as it was an early settlement site and was later used as a CCC camp in the 1930 's and a Conscientious Objector camp in the 1940 's. History buffs can learn more at nearby  museums in Cascade Locks, Hood River, Stevenson or at Bonneville Dam.",

President Franklin D. Roosevelt formed the CCC during the Great Depression. Wind, rain, and natural elements caused the deterioration of the buildings over the years. In 1987 a volunteer group, Friends of White Rock, began a project to renovate the structures. With a lot of hard work, the cabins and lodge were restored in 1991. Visitors to White Rock Mountain enjoy scenic views from the cabins. White Rock Mountain is 2,260 feet above sea level and received its name from the appearance of the lichen on the sheer bluffs that look white from a distance. High bluffs surround this area. Please use caution while along the bluff line, especially with small children. White Rock Mountain is the hub of several trail systems. It offers a 13.4-mile loop trail south to Shores Lake and returns to intersect with the Ozark Highlands Trail. Around the rim of the mountaintop is a 1.5-mile loop trail. 3 rental cabins and a lodge. All three feature stone fireplaces and original furniture. The lodge can accommodate up to 30 people a night and is accessible to the physically challenged. The cabins can be rented year-round. 8 family camping units with tent pads and fire pits and one group site that will accommodate up to 10 guests. 8 family picnicking units.",

Sky Lakes Wilderness occupies the crest of the High Cascades, extending south from the boundary of Crater Lake National Park to Fourmile Lake. The wilderness has gentle, densely forested terrain with occasional steep areas. The name derives from the many small lakes, most of them clustered in several glacial basins near the crest of the Cascade Range. Several species of trees including Shasta red fir, western white pine, mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce and whitebark pine are found throughout the area. The forest 's understory is dominated by species of huckleberry, as well as manzanita, snowbrush, and heather. There are 29 camp sites with RV parking including one host site, two sets of vault toilets, nine horse camps, and two hand pumps for water. Some sites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Look for boat trailer and passenger vehicle parking in boat ramp and day use areas. Please follow directional signage and park in a responsible manner. Fourmile Lake's water level fluctuates with clear, pristine snowmelt each year. The shoreline is a mix of sand and pebbly rocks, and exceptional views of Mt. McLoughlin highlight this lakeside campground. Visitors to the area will enjoy a variety of activities including hiking, backpacking, climbing, kayaking, canoeing, rafting, horse packing, bird watching, stargazing, fishing, and horse camping.

Tumwater Campground sits on an alluvial fan and is prone to debris flows and flooding, resulting from conditions created by the Chiwaukum Fire of 2014. The lack of vegetation recovery across the upper watersheds of Chiwaukum, Hatchery, and Thompson Creeks makes these drainages prone to flooding and debris flows which can directly affect Tumwater Campground. There is still much work to be done to bring this site to a safe condition after 5 years of being closed. The main issue now is to remove hazard trees. Safety of the public is of utmost importance and we are making sure that all hazards are mitigated prior to making it available for use. Located along Highway 2 and the Wenatchee River in Tumwater Canyon, 11 miles from Leavenworth. The group site includes shelter with a fireplace. There is also a basketball court.",

    "description": "Spend a night outdoors in the Forest Service 's first developed campground, which originally opened  in 1916 at the dawn of America 's love affair with car camping! Located in the central Columbia River Gorge, the campground is great for a weekend of hiking, boating, fishing, and other adventures  in one of the most scenic places in the Pacific Northwest. Campsites are situated between large trees atop a bluff above Eagle Creek and the Columbia River. Interstate 84 and a railroad run nearby, so the campground may be too noisy for some (especially sites 7-14).Out of the 17 campsites, 14 must be reserved at  www.recreation.gov and three are  available on a first-come, first-served basis. Reserve early -- up to six  months in advance -- to ensure a spot at this popular campground, which books up early between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Reservations are strongly encouraged, as the three  walk-up sites fill quickly on summer weekends. Each site has  a paved parking spot, and most are fully accessible. A  full-time host is on site. The site is best for tent camping, as there are no RV hookups and a 20 foot trailer limit due to small spaces and tight curves on the road leading up to the campground. A new vault toilet constructed in 2018 preserves the site 's historic charm with its rugged Cascadian architecture. The  campground is part of the Eagle Creek Recreation Area  which also features  the Historic Eagle Creek Trail. The trail was built along a cliff overlooking Eagle Creek, starting in 1916, and  still considered one of the most popular and scenic hikes in the Gorge. Several other area trails, including  Buck Point, Ruckel Creek #405, and Wauna Point #402, are still closed from the 2017 fire. In fall, the nearby picnic area  is a good site to watch  spawning salmon, and there are fishing opportunities nearby, but campers must possess a valid Oregon fishing license and follow state rules. The Gorge has many other adventures to offer",

An interesting trip is to explore the mining history of the area by touring the Land of the Yankee Fork north of the Sunbeam Dam and resort on Forest Road #013. Sunbeam Dam was the only dam ever built on the Salmon River, which remains one of the last free-flowing rivers in the west. The dam was intended to provide power to mining operations located on the Yankee Fork, but in 1911, the mine property was sold at a Sheriff`s auction and part of the dam was destroyed with dynamite in 1934.",

Six large ramadas include picnic tables, fire rings, grills, and vault toilets. Parking space is limited; trailers and RVs should seek alternative locations. \n\nNatural Features: The stark contrast between the nearby Bulldog Cliffs and the adjacent Lower Salt River create a unique desert landscape for forest visitors to enjoy. The desert is spotted with saguaro and prickly pear cacti, wildflowers, and grasses which all provide habitat for \"desert dwellers\" such as rattlesnakes, horned lizards, coyotes and roadrunners. The riparian area provides for large cottonwoods on the shore and eel grass in the river. Bass, trout, great blue heron, and barn owls call the river home, while mule deer and bighorn sheep visit frequently to quench their thirst. \n\nEven with its close proximity to the Phoenix metro, the area can be harsh for travelers not equipped to meet nature on her own terms. Hot temperatures and little moisture are typical conditions in the summer. In winter, temperatures are often pleasant during the day, but can drop significantly at night. Visitors should come prepared for a variety of weather conditions, including occasional rain and lightning storms.\n\nNearby Attractions: Saguaro Lake is approximately 5 miles northeast on Bush Highway. Scenic views, fishing, boat rentals, tours, and a restaurant provide opportunities that can easily fill the day.\n",
