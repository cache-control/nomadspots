Primitive Camping:Camping is primitive, with no facilities such as tables, toilets or drinking water. Wildlife:The diversity of habitats along the road attracts a variety of wildlife, so stop frequently to scan the surrounding area. During the breeding season in spring, watch for nesting bald eagles and listen for loons calling from the water. Walk along the edge of the bay in the spring and fall and scan the adjacent trees and shrubs for migrating songbirds. In the summer, stop for a swim and watch for waterfowl feeding in the shallow bay. This is also an important winter deer range as the browse line on the trees indicates. Small Boats Allowed:Trails traverse the area and provide a wonderful experience.  Depending on water levels, the boat launch may be used to launch small boats.  Kayak and canoe access is available.

There is one vaulted toilet and four campsites, each with a picnic table and fire grate, and one hitching post. This is a good choice for a stop-over, as Moss Meadows has four corrals but no options for short trail rides. It's about 20 miles from Moss Meadows to Currier Springs on the Fremont National Recreation Trail. Another option is to ride west from Moss Meadow along the road for about five miles to the Chewaucan River. You need to get permission to ride along the river, as it passes through private land. There are signs posted with contact info or you can obtain phone numbers from the Paisley Ranger District. There is no; portable water. Visitors need to pack plenty of water",

The site is not developed, but dispersed camping opportunities are limited. This location is also stop #6 on the Glade Top Trail Scenic Byways tour. The 1930s plat book shows J.W. Findley as the owner of the land now known as Wolf Junction. Other individuals owned the land before Mr. Findley, but he left a lasting impression that is part of Ozarks history. Mr. Findley was a noted author, local historian, and was known as the walking preacher of the Ozarks. In his retirement, J.W. Findley wrote 8 books, each relating to the Missouri Ozarks. He was 92 years old when he died in 1990 while living in Ava, MO. You can tell by the following quote that J.W. Findley was fond of the Ozarks: \"And when Indian Summer comes and God hangs a shimmering curtain of blue purple over these Ozark Hills, and the trees put on their robes of scarlet and gold, just take a drive over the Glade Top (Skyline) drive and you'll say you've seen a little bit of Ozark Glory, too. God must have loved our hills a lot, or He wouldn't have made so many of them.\" (Ozark Glory,1985 J.W. Findley)The White River Historical Society located in Forysyth, MO was very helpful in gathering information for this stop. If you would like to learn more about Taney County history, visit their website http://wrvhs.org/. According to the 1930s plat book, lands now known as Willie Lee were once owned by the Rialto Land and Mining Co. in the 30s. The company owned several acres of land in the immediate area. Research has not found much information regarding this company.",

Today, it's listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. If you want a break from recreating, it's convenient to visit the Fort Klamath park and museum. Annie Creek offers more amenities than the average Sno-Park. As an official stop on the Oregon Volcanic Scenic Byway, you'll find an interpretive kiosk, as well as two vaulted toilets. An attractive log-style warming shelter with wood stove and benches is open year round for picnics and relaxation. Snowmobilers can enjoy cruising under snow covered ponderosa pines and accessing miles and miles of trails. There are no managed cross country ski trails from Annie Creek. Besides snowmobiling, winter enthusiasts of all ages flock to Annie Creek Sno-Park for excellent sledding opportunities. Adjacent to the warming shelter lies a huge bowl shaped hill perfect for coasting your sled down. At an elevation of 4,400 feet, Annie Creek generally sees snow from late November through February.

The area is known for camping, scenic driving, picnicking, birding, wildlife viewing, hiking, mountain biking, and history. There are no amenities at this site. Refer to our Dispersed Camping page for more information and dispersed camping best practices.\nHospital Flat is so named because in the 1880s it served as a site for a field hospital for ailing soldiers from Fort Grant. That frontier outpost is located along Grant Creek on the south slope of the Pinale?os. The restorative powers of this cool mountain meadow, carpeted with wildflowers and traversed by a small creek, were sufficiently notable that it also became a summer retreat for officers and their families trying to escape the heat of their desert outpost. Fort Grant was closed in 1905 and now serves as an Arizona State Prison Facility. Hospital Flat still serves as a popular refuge for forest recreationists who come to its pleasant surroundings for much the same reason as those soldiers.\nNote: Black bear area. Store and dispose of all food in bear-proof containers and trash bins, or keep it locked in your vehicle. Vehicles (including trailers) longer than 22 feet are not recommended because of the difficulty of negotiating the switchbacks on AZ 366. This dispersed camping area is not accessible by vehicle from November 15 to April 15 when the Swift Trail is closed for the winter. Early or late snow may extend the inaccessible season.",

Please do not cut down trees or shrubs; they provide natural scenery and shade-not firewood. Please do not carve on the trees. Carving leaves a wound where fungus can enter and kill the tree.Please do not deposit fish remains in the lakes and clean fish away from the water. Please wrap fish remains and other highly spoilage meats, food, etc., in small plastic bags, then in bread wrappers, and/or newspapers. Pack out all trash on your way out of the campground and fishing area.Please pick up litter around your campsite and pack it out with you.

Old Thomasson Mill Spring was the original name for this beautiful spring back in the days when a small grist mill by that name stood nearby.

The site has a colorful history.  Thomasson water mill operated along the Morgan Spring branch until the early 1900's and B.B. Morgan operated an aquaculture business that provided millions of aquarium plants all around the world. All of this beauty could have been at the bottom of a lake if the Army Corps. had not met such fiery opposition from Morgan and others who wanted to preserve the Eleven Point River for posterity. The Eleven Point River was protected by the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, and the Narrows property entered into Forest Service ownership in 1972.

The improvements include: new campsites clustered near toilet facilities at Moon Flats, John's Creek, and Conto Gulch; an upgraded horse camp at Gypsy Meadows; delineation of sites with gravel and boulders; updated sites (see maps); fire rings; animal resistant food lockers; and graveled parking surfaces at many sites. Most of the sites have features that are accessible to individuals with disabilities. The primary purpose of the Sullivan Creek Recreation Site Enhancement project is to enrich recreational opportunities, reduce soil compaction, reduce erosion, decrease sediment flow into Sullivan Creek, enhance fish habitat, improve sanitation, and reduce the potential for animal conflicts with forest visitors. Other projects in Sullivan Creek that are part of the Boundary Dam License include: the Mill Pond Dam removal; recreational improvement projects; installation of large wood jams to improve fish habitat; fish management projects; and road improvement projects, including culvert replacements.",

Canoeing: This is a popular stopping point for people canoeing on the Eleven Point River. Fishing: Wade or float fishing for bass, rainbow trout, and pan fish. Wading occurs, but the extremely cold water and swift current may be hazardous. Travelers by road, park at the trailhead and can walk in to gain river access and picnic. Tables and grills are available. If you are floating into the camp, the access upriver is Whitten (FS), downriver is Riverton East (FS).",

    "description": "This small, remote campground and picnic area located at the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp of 1937 provides a quiet setting for escaping from your normal routine. With just 8 individual campsites and a picnic shelter, it is enjoyed by campers, picnickers, mountain bikers, equestrians, and hikers. The Berryman Trail leaves from this recreation area, and traverses 24 miles of scenic Ozark countryside and winding through timbered stands and fields. The hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding offer one a pleasant measure of solitude and quiet. The western section of the trail also serves as part of the Courtois Section of the Ozark Trail. History of the Berryman CCC Camp The Berryman CCC Camp, also known as Lost Creek, was home to the 3733rd Company and was designated Camp Number F-MO-13. The camp's initial construction began on May 29, 1935, under the command of Lieutenant Charles C. Isely. Twelve men were selected from Company 732 at Boss, Missouri to be the first enrollees of the 3733rd Company and were to be in charge of the cooking, road work, and other work that required special training.; The early camp conditions were described by Robert Fechner, author of What the CCC Is and Does: Company 3733, Berryman, MO, as follows: The men lived in one of the uncompleted buildings for two weeks, cooking and eating in the open, and in all enduring hardships that in the light of the present conditions, seem unreal. The initial camp enrollees were tasked with &;lifting the camp out of the mud and brush; (Direct Advertising Company 1937:146). Presumably this colorful language meant that the camp location was cleared of brush, trees, and other vegetation and the landforms leveled so that construction of buildings could begin.

It is best suited for small RV's or tent camping.\nHistory: Bill Buffington was interviewed by John Ogmundson about his younger days and trails in the early 1900's up near Metaline Falls, Washington. Bill talked about there being a lot of gold washers coming up the river. They would come up the old mining trail from Waneta where the last bridge is on the river before it goes into the Columbia. That trail came all the way up the Columbia River and around the west bank of the Pend Oreille all the way down to Metaline Falls at the top of the hill, also known as old Blue Ribbon Trail. Cooper's trail was a good wide trail he said. A trail out to Coooper's cook shack used to cross the river at Z Canyon, where one of the forks led up to an old cabin above Crescent Lake.",

Tumwater Campground sits on an alluvial fan and is prone to debris flows and flooding, resulting from conditions created by the Chiwaukum Fire of 2014. The lack of vegetation recovery across the upper watersheds of Chiwaukum, Hatchery, and Thompson Creeks makes these drainages prone to flooding and debris flows which can directly affect Tumwater Campground. There is still much work to be done to bring this site to a safe condition after 5 years of being closed. The main issue now is to remove hazard trees. Safety of the public is of utmost importance and we are making sure that all hazards are mitigated prior to making it available for use. Located along Highway 2 and the Wenatchee River in Tumwater Canyon, 11 miles from Leavenworth. The group site includes shelter with a fireplace. There is also a basketball court.",
